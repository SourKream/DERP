 <CTX> Somehow the people I have met most into etymology have *also* been stereotypical grammar nazis. Not sure how that happens.	That's true. Many people into etymology are into it to get to the "true meaning" of a word in my experience too.	I've not made a comprehensive study of the MM, but not a lot of monsters have magic weapon attacks, there is a LOT of non-magical b/p/s, even at the high levels.	0
 <CTX> I did. I've seen every episode of The X-Files at LEAST 3 times and most of the episodes are more than that. I want new stories in that universe, I don't NEED mulder and skullly back but I do want more paranormal investigation by a secret faction within the FBI.I don't really want a reboot, but if that's what it takes to get more of those stories then I'm ok with it. I want to believe. 	Do you listen to the x-files files with kumail nanjiani? 	Really?   This is the first I've heard of this where are the clues? 	0

 <CTX> Ah okay. I wasn't aware that Rock Band does not have hi-hats or cymbals. DrumMania in the arcade has both, plus the latest ones even have double bass, so it's closer to a real set.	DrumMania looks pretty crazy. I'll have to keep my eye out for one. 	Im on board, that sucked...	0
 <CTX> Whoops my bad for being actually retarded. No need to be a complete shit head. Is it the BLACK Titan that is a dual board? I should have googled rather than relying upon my intuition you are correct. Sorry asshole.Also what is he comparing overall score for reference? Against the high end gaming pc? If so then it's not a fair comparison like I said.Also why am I in error for thinking the GTX Titan performs in benchmarks better than the GTX 970? As far as I know the OP is referring to benchmarks with his concerns, so I didn't really consider or care about real world performance since it's irrelevant to the discussion.God, we all know benchmarks don't usually tell a whole lot about real world, where did I say the Titan beats it in real world? I was talking about benchmarks because he was talking about benchmarks. the direct compute score in passmark for the GTX Titan absolutely shits on the GTX 970 which could be a major consideration in other benchmark programs.

 <CTX> Look. People have the right to live their lives as they see fit. As long as your friend is happy and the guy is happy that is all that matters.Now, having said all that, being a sugar baby is definitely sex work. The guy does take care of the sugar baby with an allowance and sometimes he will give gifts. That is absolutely true. But in exchange, the sugar baby is providing pussy on demand to the guy. Don't get angry at me or insult me. This is what his happening. It is important to face reality. No matter what else the relationship may include, it definitely includes sex in exchange for money.	Um, duh? I was highlighting non-obvious aspects of the sex-for-money gig. 	Yeah like summoning lake trolls.	0

 <CTX> I'd like it if each province had a "Minority culture." Anytime a culture is converted the old culture becomes the minority. It would still contribute a small amount towards unrest and could be removed at additional cost, and if their rebels rise up they may regain the majority. The process of conversion needs to be more organic as well. Discounts for adjacent cultures, penalties if you are converting a well established one etc. 	I think the culture conversion system should work similarly to colonization.	Cool graphs, it would also be interesting to see another one that shows the total price paid for each source's annual production.	0

 <CTX> I was trying to fill a lobby for a game of L4D2 and he started talking to me quite normally before the "You're so hot" comments started and I asked him, nicely, to stop because it was getting far too intense.

I think it had much more to do with the part where it was female, sexual organs, and entirely NOT the kind of injury you'd expect to see at a bar.	0

 <CTX> I buy Obama not going. He has an incredible security detail and his presence would have probably messed up the march. Not sending Kerry or Biden though was a big mistake.	If he would have gone, people who want any reason to criticize him would have jumped on him for spending X amount of money to attend a foreign event.	1. No, liberty of expression and the free exchange of ideas shouldn't be the privilege of the non-incarcerated.2.

 <CTX> Once met an old Brit in his late 40's early 50's who had yellow twisted teeth with black edges and old withered skin from decades of smoking that made him look older then he was.  Told me I was doing the right thing by going to China young instead of in your 30's when you had fucked your life up every which way.  He wore uncomfortably short khaki shorts and flip flops and told me that I was doing the right thing going out with a Rainy from a well off family instead of some "whore village girl." He then rambled on for a few minutes about how his misadventures in Macau/Thailand and how he had a different girlfriend in every province (save Tibet/Xinjiang) and how he still had to pay child support to his ex in London.The whole exchange made me realize I wasn't that much of a loser after all.

 <CTX> When I'm with my female friends (girlfriends wouldn't be the best term here)  and they completely generalize us men.

I have done nothing to cross women, and I don't plan on it, so stop saying that because I am a man, I instantly become a dirtbag.	Yeah man, women suck aye?	Birdman is not very good.	0
 <CTX> I'll be honest, sometime ago I did have somewhat pro-russian views. I really did think they weren't that bad. I myself am half Latvian and half Ukrainian, but my family speaks Russian and I've been watching Russian TV for my whole life (although I do occasionally switch to Latvian channels for the movies. Can't miss that), so I've been under some influence from Russia for a lot of time.I watch russian news (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b) and euronews every day. But yesterday, a very interesting thing happened. In the "\u0412\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438" there was a video of the PM of DPR saying that they don't see point in peace when they are the offending ones and will go into an offensive. That already made me think.But then, it's 8 PM (the Latvian rebroadcast is at 8PM - 9PM for Russia) with "\u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f", the main news programme of the day.There is no mention of the offensive of the DNR. They cut it out. Apparently they've accidentally slipped it through before what happened today.If I won't forget to, I will update the post later today to tell you what has been in the news. I have to note that on euronews it was said that DPR **DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE [Mariupol] ATTACK**. Let's see.edit: grammarEDIT2: Evening News. Not much new, but it was said that the militias (\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0446\u044b/opolchentsy) denied that it was them - they said there was no artillery of theirs in the area. Apparently a **kiev provocation** (they called it like that, and the channel of course quoted them).EDIT3: Vremya (\u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f). Apparently it was "Ukrainians firing from Stariy Krim" according to "eyewitnesses"(with only a video as the "eyewitness", which sounds a bit scripted), or from the DPR's SNBO clone that it was fired from somewhere else but totes not DPR.Also, about the offensive. Now they showed footage of people at the memorial service for the bus stop attack saying that DPR should go into an offensive, that they supported the army and stuff like that. And yes, there was a tank with people kind of saluting, not sure how to describe that.	more russians need to wake up!	That's a *REALLY* good point, though. Even though I'm expecting a sizable refund (that's already spent) hopefully...	0

Now is not the time to get into a food war.Philly, your cheese steaks are quite delicious. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Not ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^as ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^delicious ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^as ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Italian ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Beef ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^though.Chicago, your deep dish pizzas are the best.	Italian Beef?  I believe what you are referring to is "Tube Steak, smothered in underwear", which as I understand it as a Chicago delicacy.  DON'T YOU EVER DISRESPECT THE CHEESETEAK.	It's reached the stage where am opinion held by ten plus people is a cirlcejerk. It's get thrown around so much. 	0
 <CTX> Yeah see you can pay $900 a month for your lonely house in a fat shithole like Utah, or you can live in a fucking gorgeous apartment in America's most beautiful city where you wake up to a view of the Golden Gate bridge everyday, can bike to work in 5 minutes, walk literally everywhere, and cruise down the Pacific Coast Highway whenever you god damn please. 	I absolutely do not contest that San Francisco and surrounding areas are beautiful. But I can assure you that you are the most obnoxious fucker in this thread. Different strokes for different folks.	Oh really? Let me ask if they got them. 	0
 <CTX> Implying line cooks aren't contributing members of society?! Condescending fuck. Also, not a line cook btw	Seriously, especially in a thread about going out on dates. 	*He bows his head*I hope you like it.	0
 <CTX> Yo I am not even kidding. My girlfriend broke up with me this summer. She told me she wanted me to marry her every day, we were best friends and we drove around looking at houses and all that other B.S. It's been pretty bad and life-changing and shit so I've been really in the dumps.But when I read that part about you arranging the shoes on the fucking staircase, each pair on each staircase... and saw the picture... I laughed harder than I have laughed in months and months. Like so god damn hard, I am still laughing writing this. That's too god damn funny.I just wanted to really let you know how much you just made my day and made a stranger happy as hell. God damn you're like an evil Martha Stewart. I can't stop laughing. Thank you.	Hey man shit happens with chiks....sometimes its better to not wonder why it happened like that and just move on....Stay strong.	Yeah, sure! I'm available to trade right now, if you are. Otherwise, we can figure something out over pm. 	0
 <CTX> Me too, I had so much excitement and fond memories of Diablo 2 I couldn't resist.  Learned my lesson now.	Thank you I'll check it out.	one hopes that 4 months is enough time to record what is happening - wish i could propose the concept of "post-planning"	0
 <CTX> When I first started driving one I would always catch myself honking at stop signs and trying to use my turn signal as forward/reverse. 	There was a tunnel going to and from work, and i would constantly find my self honking, before I entered and exited it. Safety first i guess? Haha 	You could sell a kidney, you only need one of those I hear.	0
 <CTX> It's like he thinks the hate for him begins and ends hereWell I've got some bad news for you, 'brotherman'	Everywhere he goes is a toilet we can all just clog up with dank shit. 	 " Back alleyway, five minutes?"	0
 <CTX> Two of them, but with Cherry MX Browns and Clears. :D	for some reason I thought your username was lesbianUSB, but it's not.	No man, unless you are Arabic or Israeli you would be impeding the peace process. You gotta give these bros some space or else you'll be taking valuable peace pussy away from those who desperately need it. 	0
 <CTX> Has humanity gone too far?	YOU WONT BELIEVE #10	oh wow I never even realized that....what a nasty combo...hahaha 	0
 <CTX> In this scenario don't blame BitPay, blame users who decrease their personal supply of bitcoin (converting it into goods and services) without replenishing.  But I don't think it has as much affect compared to actual traders on the exchanges in conjunction with the 10% annual supply increase.	I decrease my personal supply of Bitcoin without replenishing because I need to pay bills and buy food for my family. Do you blame me?	If you think about it, you might actually guess her emotions right through her ahoge.	0
 <CTX> Well then... let's hope it's real.Another point: What's the Kurd's view on the Lebanese Hezbollah?	Not the question for me to answer as I don't know very much about Hezbollah or the conflicts it's been involved in except for the part they've taken in fighting Daesh in Iraq. 	My head exploded at the numbers. Seriously, TIL there are numbers that high, and some near impossible to pronounce.	0
 <CTX> I seriously don't understand the Toradora! hype.  I watched it all the way through, but it just left me wondering why is this considered a great anime? I didn't think the character development was as remarkable as people made it out to be. Taiga and most of the other characters annoyed the shit out of me. It is an average anime at the most, in my opinion.  	You know, JC staff's majority of works tend to really entertain and fulfill the younger audience who are fondly of an idealistic and unrealistic melodrama. 	Yea, but this way my old comments will be gone/not associated with me anymore.	0
 <CTX> It's likely he's leaving this window.	Borini is there and its way more likely hes leaving this month	Just HOW does one discover their parakeet likes tong rides?  At what point do you wake up and think "ya know-I need to grip my bird with these tongs".	0
 <CTX> There was very high inflation in the late 80s. I suspect they extrapolated that forward.	Same with the 60s and 70s. Don't forget that Australia had it's highest interest rates under Fraser Howard, not Hawke Keating, and the Vietnam war was hardly good for the economy.	They changed it only for presidential nominations. You can still filibuster today. 	0
