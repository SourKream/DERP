 <CTX> The title really annoyed me. It should've been&gt;Oh so they CAN fly!	Came here to say this.	That would change the entire point. It isn't "Oh, moonkins can fly", it is "Oh, so NPC Druids are allowed to fly"	1
 <CTX> I agree with you for the most part but I also think the bioluminescent armor is the only real prestige armor in this game, so it's okay if it's somewhat inaccessible to the larger population. You gotta really want it, and also be a bit masochistic. <CTX> Because they were 1.) beyond the difficulty of some of this game's casual audience, and 2.) extremely poorly designed in forcing a ton of unskippable dialogue and trash fights for every screw-up.I don't fault any of the 30 or so players I helped through Seeds of Truth for seeking outside assistance, because they deserved better. <CTX> The Seeds of Truth achieves were pretty fun to do though, why bother trying to "trick" your way through them? <CTX> World Summit is easy if you know the trick - there's an entire section of the arena that's immune to 2/3 of the dragon's attacks (the part where Jennah hides in), only being vulnerable to his ranged spit and his room-wide stomp.Seeds of Truth is awful though, there are no tricks for its achievements that don't involve you being in a party and having someone else be Caithe. <CTX> More of them should be like the golden cave boss, right after you finish it you can interact with the challenge mote to instantly restart the fight.World Summit achievements are the worst shit ever though.	It would be if it was not the only one and achievements didn't matter otherwise	&gt; prestigi just need 1 more coat armor to complete the achievement, been farming vinewrath for the past 4 days still havnt dropped fml	1
 <CTX> I totally think he's trying to punish me now because I just got a text saying "you're going to be our closer tomorrow" I was supposed to come in at three and leave early but now I'll be there all night. :/ <CTX> Your manager's an asshole. You go and enjoy your new job! :)	That's easy. Send him the gif. 	Do you need the money? Just leave. If he fires you so what.	1
 <CTX> The accent is not american for me, more like British, and that please at the end.And it's Azov battalion, they are open about accepting foreign volunteers. I saw an interview with couple Swedish guys in there.	"... please" maybe he's Canadian and being polite?	I dont understand. Why do they volunteer? They want to fight the good fight?	1
 <CTX> I can right now. ~~I'll adding your FC and getting online with IGN Maya~~ I'm online and waiting. <CTX> I sure can, just let me know when you can get on. :) <CTX> Hi, can you hatch an egg for me please?	Okay, adding you now and getting on. :)	On and ready. :)	1
 <CTX> I think Bama still. When it was 21-6 that game could've got out of hand, but they never pulled the trigger. I think Bama wins that game most of the time. <CTX> Who the fuck was then? <CTX> Oregon looked nervous as hell. Ohio State deserved it and got incredibly hot at the right time, but I still don't think they were the best team this year.I'm going down with the ship.	We fucking dominated that game, the score does not indicate how dominate we were. Zeke ran for 200+, held Alabama for 2-13 on 3rd downs, and held Cooper to how many yards? 9 catches for 71? That's domination. 	So you are saying that wins don't count anymore, good to know &lt;3	1
 <CTX> Was I talking out loud?  <CTX> We can't stop here, this is bat country! <CTX> We were somewhere outside of /r/Netflixbestof/ when the drugs began to take hold. 	It's ok, I'm just admiring the shape of your skull.	Is this not an appropriate place to park?	1
 <CTX> Linky?	I gained a raging boner from this.Apparently, this, right mjah, is ma fetish.	Thanks, I really needed another weird fetish.	1
 <CTX> I'm an American, so I imagine many parts of my experience are different, but I do this all of the time and it has never occurred to me that someone might consider it problematic. The package will scan the same if it's empty or not, so I don't understand what the objection is. <CTX> Apart from parents giving their kids something to be quiet, which is understandable, do people actually do this? I'd be worried about the security guard telling me off.	Theft is frowned upon. 	It's politeness. That fact you can't wait 5 minutes. Usually against store policy anyway.	1
 <CTX> That's your opinion. Robert E. Lee was against slavery. He chose to fight for his home state of Virginia instead of the Union. If that makes him bad in your eyes then so be it but it's not as black and white as people want it to be. <CTX> I won't argue your point in principal that "just because they ended up on the wrong side doesn't mean they were bad people", but fuck that noise. They made a conscious decision to betray their country and fight for a state that subjugated other humans. They are fucking horrible people. Fuck them. <CTX> Robert E. Lee and Jackson were confederate generals. It shouldn't be offensive though Robert E. Lee was one of the greatest Americans ever. Just because they ended up on the wrong sides doesn't mean they were bad people. Also they are 2 of the best generals in the history of the U.S. <CTX> Can you explain why that's offensive? The wiki doesn't say very much and I don't know who those two people are. <CTX> Are there any black kids there?  I just moved to Minnesota from Florida so i noticed why this school up here doesn't celebrate it. <CTX> I...I have school...we've never had MLK day off here... <CTX> Not even all schools either. <CTX> It's a "bank holiday" schools are closed, banks are closed, non-essential government facilities are closed. Everything else is business as usual.Most people are working today. <CTX> I'm jealous of their bromance. I'm jealous of that sexy hot tub and its view. And most of all I'm jealous that you dang 'Muricans get the day off work today to celebrate like this. Have a drink for me.	The argument that he was against slavery is contrived as hell. 	Robert E Lee was most certainly not anti slavery.  He was, at best, indifferent.	1
 <CTX> So... she should go in the womens on her own? Or not go at all? Or pay someone to look after her for you? Because they are not really appropriate either are they? <CTX> I think they mean inappropriate for the father to take a young girl into the men's locker room. Not inappropriate for the girl to make remarks about the penises.  <CTX> It's a fucking kid. They do this kind of shit all the time.	Cut out that logic, we won't have that here	I wasn't commenting on wether or not the father should have taken her in the locker room. I completely agree that he should have. I was just pointing out what the other person comment was actually saying.	1
 <CTX> so take the keys have it towed to another mechanic for inspection and then take him to court? <CTX> I would ask to see proof that cylinder work was done outside of his shop and then he's going to have to explain to me why he put used/worn/damaged rings into a freshly rebuilt engine, I would tell him you're going to have it looked at by another mechanic to verify the work was done and done right if not I will see you in court. <CTX> thank you for your response i 100% agree with this. but what do i do just walk in take my keys and refuse to pay him? <CTX> Sounds like you got took, if he was reshaping/honing the cylinders he would have been installing new rings on the Pistons, I say you're being scammed.	I would first start with seeing what documentation there is on the work, he did say he had the cylinder work done by someone else right?	If it's a mechanics lien state, you might not be able to just "take the key and have it towed"	1
 <CTX> still don't understand why people watch other people play a video game... maybe some day ill give it a try :\	"Still don't understand why some people watch others play a sport . Maybe someday I'll try it." The answer is because its entertaining (to some people). 	Agreed. Cannot fathom as to why anyone would watch a streamer. Let alone 5K people or whatever he gets. I watch Netflix personally. 	1
 <CTX> The video is not a full list, just the strongest ones in each category.Tanks: Stitches - Arthas - Muradin - TyraelRanged: Valla - Tychus - Nazeebo - Tassadar - ZagaraMelee: Kerrigan - Zeratul - ThrallSupports: Brightwing - Uther - Malfurion <CTX> Anyone have the list for those of us who cant load up the video right now? 	Interesting, I was under the impression that Muradin was universally thought of as the weakest tank	Surprised at not seeing Li Li mentioned. I've taken her up and the amount of healing she can pump out is nuts.	1
 <CTX> Opera uses WebKit, which is the same platform Chrome runs on. You should be able to use all your Chrome extensions on Opera.Source: I use Opera. <CTX> Think of the ~~children~~ Opera users!   ...like myself :P <CTX> The GG boycott plugin(for chrome and firefox) does that for your browser.I think there's an auto-mod that does resubmissions like that too. <CTX> Is there an autoarchive bot or something? We should deploy it here if it exists. <CTX> Thank you, no way you'll find me near that site.	I know. I just wanted a shtty joke ;)	webkit is a rendering engine, thats like saying since hitman absolution and crysis 2 both use direct3d 11,  their mods should be compatible/interchangable	1
 <CTX> OP what was the text/ message you sent out to the exes? I want to try this just to see what they'll say about me at this point. My exes I mean, not yours. 	"I need you to..." Jake's self centered, I'm guessing. 	She's sharp, that's hilarious.	1
 <CTX> How does mario galaxy look on the wii u? I heard they didn't upscale it, does it still look good or is it something you just have to deal with?	It looks the same as if you put the Wii disc into the Wii U.	It looks fine to me. It looks exactly like it would if you played it off an original Wii.	1
 <CTX> Arsene Wenger resigns.Neuer will win the Ballon d'Or in a shock result.Both Mersey-side managers will be sacked.Klopp turns Dortmund's season around and manages to qualify for Europa.	If arsenal don't get cl football I can see wenger leaving and possibly retiring, although he would easily be able to find a top club.Dortmund can easily get Europe if a starting 11 can stay fit.	Neuer better start underwear modeling then.	1
 <CTX> But the c4 was on the outside not inside and recon was in blast range...Should have been support stepping outside, turning and seeing the recon a safe distance away THEN slowmo realization.	To be fair, there was never a time where you got to see what was on the floor, and the low FOV might give the impression that the recon is closer than he actually is :)	Exactly, the recon is further away than you think. At 04.00 the recon  actually triggers the c4 and doesn't take any damage from the explosion :) He's in the "safe zone" so to say.	1
 <CTX> The trick is learning to accept it and love it. When you do, its not so freaky and scary, its more like just conquering one challenge after another. <CTX> adulthood Q&amp;A:* Does being an adult ever stop being awful?No.  Never.  The rest of your life is a non-stop rollercoaster of freakshow-level terror and anxiety.	The best part about being an adult is that "I DO WHAT I WANT" is a good enough reason to do just about anything.	Yeah, adulthood is soooo much better than everything that happened 0-22.	1
 <CTX> &gt;When are Arab countries going to recognize IsraelWhen we rebuild third temple :D <CTX> Only the armed wing of the government of Israel fought in Lebanon or Gaza.When are Arab countries going to recognize Israel? "We don't hate you, we just hate your army's tactics." <CTX> &gt;They want to take Hamas off the terrorist list.Except the mentioned armed wing. Why is that bad? Only armed wing is responsible for terrorism, as its very big organization (de'facto whole government of Gaza) taking care of everything from security, hospitals, schools, trade, paperwork etc. So its unfair to call the terrorist someone who is working in Hamas as cook in school, or cleaner or teacher.Such decision worked fine with Fatah. It helps to pinpoint the problems and offer clear solution "we don't hate you - we just hate terrorism" etc. Which is constructive way towards peace. Divide and conquer. <CTX> Don't tell that to the Europeans! They want to take Hamas off the terrorist list.	Easy for you to say as you're *not* a priest who will have to work in it! 	I wish that were the case	1
 <CTX> Getting them off of Aliexpress is the safest bet if you're worried about getting scammed.I got one off of Taobao. It was very good quality but off on a couple details. Not bad at all for around $20.These have got to be some of the higher end ones at $88. I would continue searching on Alie until you see real pics of some that match up on all the tiny details compared to authentic.	link on your bracelet? 	What should I search on Ali to find em?	1

 <CTX> they did this wrong and missed what made Chromecast so good. this requires the manufacturer to implement Chromecast audio. instead, they should have made a tiny dongle with a 3.5mm jack and USB jack so it can plug into any speaker or audio system and make it a Chromecast-able device. why force you to buy new speakers to get this functionality?	Because they saw how much people love Sonos, and how much people spend on them.	The device you're asking for could be made by some manufacturer very easily - and who knows might already be on the way. For now you could just use a hdmi audio splitter + chromecast to get the same.	1

 <CTX> Out of curiosity, why was this change made? <CTX> The cost of building them. It used to cost gold and GR. Now it's just gold. They also increased the cost to compensate. <CTX> I'm confused about the "gold only" costs associated with LM and Trading post, is that for the work orders/trading or just to buy/build those two buildings?	I think they did it so it could be in line with the GR missions not costing GR.	So you don't need to spend resources to have a way to make resources. 	1

 <CTX> Easy bake/instant doesn't require hydration before use.  Active dry shouldn't come into contact with salt until it's well mixed into the dough.  You should use about twice as much active dry as instant yeast (or half as much instant if the recipe calls for active dry).   <CTX> One is for hand baking, the other is for machines. What is the actual difference between these two products? 	I've been using active. I usually mix all the dry ingredients and add water - are you saying that I ought to fully activate the yeast (in warm water) before adding it to the dry mix? 	Do these yeasts produce noticeably different flavours? 	1
 <CTX> I love CicLAvia and plan to do this ride, but I can't help but feel closing Lankershim and Ventura will piss off a lot of locals. edit: also, the red line from downtown could be totally packed, but Metro usually adds extra cars for this event. 	Fortunately, motorists can use the 101 and 170 to bypass those areas.And if you need to get to a business on Ventura or Lankershim, you could always just park nearby and \*shudder\*... walk there.	&gt; but I can't help but feel closing Lankershim and Ventura will piss off a lot of locals.uhhhh how has it gone for the other locals at all the other ciclavias?	1
 <CTX> How would you ensure that the upper layer moves before the bottom does? (The movement always starts from the edge of the star inwards)We can carefully pick materials with different frictions, but I was wondering if there's a more elegant solution.  <CTX> Ohhhhhhhh...? Wait. What?Edit: Just viewed this explanation on desktop and it made way more sense. You should see the mess you made with that diagram on mobile. <CTX> Here is how I would have done it as somewhat mechanically inclined person:The top layer has pegs protruding down. Each successive layer has holes for the pegs to pass trough. Each hole is X amount bigger than the previous one. this way there is X amount of slop between each successive layer.    PEG --&gt;  ||            HOLE --&gt;   ====        =====    ---------------------------------------------------    =========              ========           =========    ===||  ===            === || ===         ===  ||===    ===||   ===          ===  ||  ===       ===   ||===    ===||    ===        ===   ||   ===     ===    ||===    PEG LEFT             PEG MIDDLE           PEG RIGHT <CTX> I NEED TO KNOW HOW, OP.OP.TEACH ME.	Well, they're moving the top layer, right? We have no idea what it looks like holding the top steady and moving the bottom.	It's the size of the holes. Lower layers have larger holes, so as you move the peg, it'll come in contact with the edge later.	1
 <CTX> Shoutout to my boys /u/CocaineKeys, /u/3200math, and our newest member of the mod team /u/THE_WHITEST_DUDE.	Oh wow I totally forgot about cocainekeys.

 <CTX> Part of the multimillion dollar deal he signed was to talk to the media. The dude needs to grow up and just talk to them like a normal human. <CTX> Just leave the guy alone. He doesn't want to talk to the media, and when he does he just gives nonsensical or uninformative answers. This has been going on for years now. It's clear he does not give a fuck about the fines, and I don't buy for a second that Lynch not doing interviews is costing the NFL a dime. There are plenty of popular players that do like to talk, and they all basically give the same generic shit answers anyway, so why keep pursuing this one player in particular? Just let it go.	Clearly, he doesn't. He can afford not to. Though, maybe if the media treated players like normal human beings, this wouldn't even be an issue.	because clearly introverted people or people who dont talk well in front of a camera or who simply dont like interacting with the media arent people	1
 <CTX> Don't add the noodles and use your own! <CTX> Found it hard to believe a large portion of the sodium comes from the noodles.Looked it up.Mind blown. <CTX> Don't add the packet. Use your own spices. <CTX> I always feel bad when I read the sodium level on the packet.  <CTX> Sometimes I add broccoli or other veggies so I don't feel so terrible about letting my kids eat them. 	So take the ramen package, discard the seasoning and use my own, discard the noodles and use my own?Be real with me, should I just make fucking spaghetti?	Make your own home made noodles!

 <CTX> We got top dollar for a '03 police interceptor after the transmission started throwing spark plugs. The only thing they asked was to pop the hood (to check for a battery) and the trunk. Worth looking into at the very least. <CTX> the scrap yard will give you that. sell it as parts if it's not running and get at LEAST $800 for it. if the tires are in good shape, mention that too <CTX> You can probably get about $500 for your truck if you post it on craigslist. Add that to your car fund. You can get a reliable corolla or civic for that much.

 <CTX> It's especially important considering they are switching to methane as fuel and that very likely means a lower TWR. Without solid boosters it becomes crucial to get everything they can out of the engines, even if it means having a stupidly large number of engines. They'll have to put up with that complexity, which is a drawback in itself. <CTX> Well, Elon said that 2.22MN is best for the TWR, which is Spacex's favorite number. But not all engines are optimized for TWR. The RS-25 has a much lower TWR, and I don't know about the BE-4. <CTX> It certainly could happen. He did say that they're not likely to develop a reusable 2nd stage for Falcon.What I find really interesting is that the latest info on Raptor puts it at the same thrust level as both Blue Origin's BE-4 and the Space Shuttle RS-25 main engine. I wonder if that's some kind of sweet spot for high efficiency?	I think the plumbing should be OK this time, even if they have to do 72 engines, \*shudders\* since they won't be disassembling the booster at the factory, shipping it by rail, and rebuilding it on the launch site.	Fortunately they will already have experience with "large number of engines", since the Falcon Heavy starts with 27 and has optional cross-feed. The N1 was not build with modern technology or practice.	1
 <CTX> If you're reading this on your smartphone in a bar or coffee shop, stand up and say loudly, "MIKE HUNT....IS MIKE HUNT HERE?"

 <CTX> My parents got divorced.  Neither I nor my brother had ever seen them argue.  They always made sure we weren't around durring arguments. Even when they were telling us we all sat down, watched a movie,  and then they told us. When they told us they made sure we knew that it wasn't our fault in any way, thay they didn't hate each other,  they just didnt love each other like they used to. That they still loved us.  Three years later, they still talk and do favors for each other,  though with the occasional argument over the phone. I was surprised when I realized most divorces don't go that well. Makes me feel lucky that I have parents awesome enough to put up with my crap *and* make sure to minimize the effect the divorce had on our lives. Even when they moved into two smaller houses instead of our old huge one,  they both stayed in the area even though it would be more convenient other places, just so my brother and I could go to the same school with our friends.I heard them argue zero times before the divorce and only two times since then. <CTX> I haven't ever seen them make an argument about anything. As far as I know, they've never raised their voices against eachother even once since they met. Sure, they discuss things, but it's like a polite debate between two politicians who agree on every subject. <CTX> I hear you there.  My parents aren't perfect, but they love me, they love each other, and an 'argument' between them involves a bit of glaring and sighing followed by hugs.Little did I know just how horrible so many other families are.  Sheesh. <CTX> Having awesome parents apparently. They were sorta strict, but I don't think I could have asked for better parents.EDIT: Thank you mysterious stranger for the gold. May your parents be awesome for a long time!	Exact opposite of my parents divorce. I'm getting married in 2016 and I can't even invite both sides of my family because they'll murder each other. :)	what movie was it? 	1

 <CTX> I have a pretty demanding major with classes that spread out each day, leaving no windows in which the therapists are available.  I checked.Thanks for the word on trust.  My therapist was a nice lady, but I was afraid to open up to her because, well, I didn't know her.  It was very odd for me. <CTX> What is it about your schedule that prevents you meeting with a university therapist?  Most colleges are pretty accommodating nowadays when it comes to their students mental health.Also, if in the future you find yourself in counseling and you are uncomfortable with your therapist, just tell him/her.  Trust is the most important thing in therapy, therapists know this and won't take it personally.  They'll help you find someone who is a better fit. <CTX> It was just the experience in therapy overall.  I was somewhat resistant at first, but I also felt I couldn't confide in my therapist--so I held a lot back.  I can't go to a counselor now because my schedule prevents me from meeting with a university therapist for the next year or so.  I really hope there's another way to get him to stay...Your last paragraph really hit home.  I've always tried to reinforce how valuable he is to me, but what you said makes sense.  I didn't think hating myself had an impact on his self-esteem, I thought it would just remind him that he could do much better and he'd leave me. <CTX> There are multiple areas of counseling (i.e. different therapy techniques) that can help build self-esteem.  And with that, there are a ridiculous number of therapists to choose from.What part of counseling didn't work?  Was it the techniques?  The therapist?  The cost?  You mentioned that counseling isn't an option right now (why is that?)  I think that this might be your only way to get him to stick around.  If you show him that you're working to improve yourself he might be willing to work with you.If you don't start making improvements you're going to drive him to a break up.  You cannot know how exhausting it is to constantly have to reassure someone.  You don't think you're good enough for him?  Well, your actions are making him feel like he isn't good enough for you.  In his mind, if he was... you'd be happy. <CTX> I don't want to break up.  He's been such a blessing, a boyfriend and a best friend.  Counseling just didn't work for me.Of course, I can't force him to stay with me, but I don't want to be the one to end things--if things have to end. <CTX> I think you are not in a good place to be in a relationship with anybody and instead you should address the issues you raised in counseling, otherwise this is exactly who you will be.	...try changing a class or two around. I'm SURE you could make time if it was something you actually wanted to do. Don't use being busy as an excuse, because that's what you're doing.	Sounds like you've made a choice internally between your happiness in relationships and this particular school schedule.Let the guy go.

 <CTX> apparently scump and formal want to go to the house too maybe nade can get something setup where og can go to the redbull studious and ON could stay at the house?	It would make more sense for ON to go to the Redbull studios since 3 members are in Cali already.	I have a feeling the OpTic LAN before Champs is going to be at the RB Studios, since Champs is in LA.	1
 <CTX> I've been watching Friends lately since it's on Netflix now; she has headlights in like 50% of the scenes. I wonder if the director just made the set really cold on purpose. <CTX> Joke's on you, I have a crush on 1990's Jennifer Aniston, too!	Have you ever watched Charmed? I don't think those actresses had ever heard of bras.	It was 1996, man, that "One Headlight" song was everywhere.	1
 <CTX> Are some of you really suggesting she calls an ambulance or rushes to the hospital? For a scratch under her eye? 	They didn't know it was under her eye, shit head	No, but disinfect it. Infections are real. 	1
 <CTX> Get Kurt Warner on the phone! <CTX> The original QBs selected to the Pro Bowl: Brady, Luck, Manning, Rodgers, Roethlisberger and Romo.Of that group, only Luck and Romo are still involved.

 <CTX> It takes two to get pregnant, carelessly or not. Why don't you hitch up that high horse and give it a rest. <CTX> You were all ready to help your buddy dodge the bullet of him having carelessly caused another person to become pregnant, so I'm sort fine with you getting glared at, even if it was technically for the wrong reasons. Like seriously? Your takeaway from that story is "and then some strangers looked at me funny." <CTX> edit: Oh. <CTX> I'm going to an abortion clinic for a family member so that'll be pretty cool reading reddit while also listening to the hushed crying of the women there.	OP's horse is so high, it makes Cheech and Chong look like Mormon missionaries.	Yeah, and she did have to deal with the pregnancy. She had to deal with more than either of the guys, which is why his complaining seems strange.	1
 <CTX> I know! I'm all for leaving space between the car in front of you but you could fit a whole car in that space. The picture doesn't do the size of this gap justice.  <CTX> That has to be intentional.  What a supreme fuckface.	I would have driven over the curb. Looks low enough for it.	Did you honk your horn or just take a picture and bitch about it online?	1
 <CTX> When you first enter the park you will see the extraordinary walls of stone that line the valley. There are turn outs for vehicles so passengers can take a look. Do so, don't be in a hurry. It's the first glimpse of the beauty that is Yosemite. Those first walls are awe inspiring IMO. Glacier Point is an absolute must see. It is the overall view of everything spectacular about Yosemite. It's breathtaking. IMO it's the single greatest view of the park, so whether you get this view first to inspire your visit, or make it the last memorable moment of your visit I leave to you. Since you are going in July the rivers may be dry which means the falls may also be dry. If you hike up to Bridalveil Fall make sure you hike up the side of the falls to the highest point. Up there you will find a pool and probably quite a few people swimming in that pool. It's small, but it's also kinda neat. If the falls are running well the pool will probably not be accessible. There is another set of falls that are common visitor points. I'm sorry I can't remember the name, but you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there. The first falls are a rather easy hike though it is all uphill. If you can take the additional hike to the upper fall area. It's very nice. In fact, if you are a serious hiker take a look at the Yosemite web page because there are several hiking trails that I wish I'd had time to follow. You could easily spend days upon days just hiking and probably never run out of extraordinary scenery. I didn't have the guts to hike half dome (I was too nervous about my children), but I'm told it's a great time. I didn't stay in the park this time so I can't offer advice on that. From what I remember as a child it was really fun to tent camp on the grounds. Take lots of pics and video (though it really won't do the park justice) and most importantly relax and take your time. Soak in everything you see and do your best to put those images in to long term memory.Best wishes  <CTX> We are going in July.  Any tips? <CTX> I took my kids to Yosemite last summer. First time I'd been back in around 25 years. As I stood on the top of Glacier Point and took in the view I honestly had a moment where I wondered if what I was seeing was in fact reality. It is so beautiful that it is easy to think that it must be a drawing. It has to be one of the top 10 most beautiful places on earth. 	Vernal and Nevada falls. Half Dome is a must see.	Mariposa Grove to the south is a must see as well. The largest trees in the world(Total size not just height) all in once place.	1
 <CTX> If Arena gave me a pack plus possible rewards for 50 gold, then why would I ever straight up buy a pack for 100 gold? I could just retire Arena runs for twice the packs! Granted I would still need to buy classic packs, but the much cheaper GVG packs from Arena would give me dust to just make what classic cards I still wanted pretty fast. <CTX> How about they drop the price of Arena to 50g per run and also drop the guaranteed pack?  People who like Arena can then play Arena more often and if they ever just want a pack, can go the store and buy it with the 100g they didn't spend on that Arena run. <CTX> it's been a week since I went back to buying classic packs and avoiding arena completely. I'm still missing a lot of classic cards (epics, legendaries) and getting a shit pack of GvG cards from arena is not helping me at all. I average about 5 wins in arena, so yeah I'm not that great at it. I don't get enough gold to get that GvG pack for free and every arena run I do is actually less classic packs I can open.I wish blizzard would give a token instead of that pack and then each player would have a choice what pack they want.	He is suggesting dropping the pack in addition to the price.	&gt; drop the guaranteed pack	1
 <CTX> I know. The cards were never published by Wizards of the Coast.edit:MTR section 3.3 covers Authorized Cards.Players may use any Authorized Game Cards from Magic: The Gathering expansions, core sets, special sets, supplements, and promotional printings. Authorized Game Cards are cards that, unaltered, meet the following conditions:* The card is genuine and published by Wizards of the Coast* The card has a standard Magic back or is a double-faced card.* The card does not have squared corners.* The card has black or white borders.* The card is not a token card.* The card is not damaged or modified in a way that might make it marked.* The card is otherwise legal for the tournament as defined by the format.The Head Judge of an event may issue a proxy (see section 3.4) for a card that has become worn or damaged during the tournament.Any other cards that are not Authorized Game Cards are prohibited in all sanctioned tournaments. Unglued and Unhinged basic land cards are allowed in sanctioned Magic tournaments.Players may use cards from the Alpha printing only if the deck is in opaque sleeves.Players may use otherwise-legal non-English and/or misprinted cards provided they are not using them to create an advantage by using misleading text or pictures. Official promotional textless spells are allowed in sanctioned Magic tournaments in which they would otherwise be legal.Artistic modifications are acceptable in sanctioned tournaments, provided that the modifications do not make the card art unrecognizable, contain substantial strategic advice, or contain offensive images. Artistic modifications also may not obstruct or change the mana cost or name of the card.The Head Judge is the final authority on acceptable cards for a tournament. <CTX> They are genuine magic cards.... He custom cut them from a actual printed sheet. <CTX> I can't understand how he's allowed to use the dual lands. They are not genuine Magic cards - he created them from a sheet. <CTX> For what it's worth, his duals are hand cut, not miscut. The value is difficult to get a read on.	hand cuts are legal for the same reason that summer cards are legal.	I don't get how you think that sheets published by WoTC aren't published by WoTC	1

The real question is: if he wins it, will he be the first in 15 years to break the curse?	So because it hasn't happened in 15 years there is a curse? How long since the Red Sox won a world series? Are they cursed again?	I was against Rodgers getting the MVP, but now I've changed my mind. Rodgers for MVP!!!	1

 <CTX> Didn't all 3 candidates say they would do a fare freeze for 2015? Basically going to be paying for someone else's kid to ride the ttc when I don't even have one. I'm all for paying my fair share and I know where the money goes but this is just making others foot the bills, and no savings unless you have kids.	You pay taxes for elementary school even though you don't have kids.  Same for Ohip to cover their eyes until 19.  This is no different.	 and those peoples kids will be paying your healthcare costs and pension when you are old. Deal with it you grumpy, shortsighted fool. 	1
 <CTX> When I got my wisdom teeth out I wanted a way to smoke without creating much auction in my mouth so I wouldn't get dry socket.... I came up with what I thought was a pretty nifty idea.... Get one of those little glass jars that has a sealing lid (I used one with a cork sealing top). Then, you take your ganja and put It in the jar right? Ok, next, grab a magnifying glass and go outside, make sure the jar is sealed so no air can get in and focus a beam of light on your ground bud.... And BAM vapor which can be easily inhaled when you uncap your jar!!! Because air can't get in, it doesn't allow the goods to combust! I found this method to be incredibly efficient, and effective. Not to mention, it's a clean and natural way to vaporize with easy clean up!  I see no reason why you couldn't implement your tube into the design and make it even better!  <CTX> Can someone double check this concept for me. I am currently working on it but would like some feedback before things go up in ~~smoke~~ (vapor).The idea is to have a hanging heating element in a glass jar. Anything else please feel free to ask. :)^Edit: ^Pretty ^much ^similar ^to ^the ^MFLB ^just ^turned ^vertically ^and ^not ^in ^wood	there's oxygen in the air inside the sealed glass. Unfortunately this still allows combustion, albeit the goods won't go up in flames. 	Just use a gravity bong.	1

 <CTX> I like getting armor too.  It would be nice if it was less random though.  I've somehow managed to get almost the whole medic outfit but I don't have the helmet.  Maybe the items you had of a set the more likely you would be to get another? <CTX> I feel like im the only one who likes getting armour in supply drops. Obviously getting gloves and knee pads that look generic is annoying but i love being able customize my guys look. The weapons never seem to make that big of a difference IMO. Its sweet that they're doing this though. I wish there was a trade in system for supply drops. If you have 2 elite items you can trade it in for a supply drop. 4 Professional items for a supply drop. 6 Enlisted items for a supply drop. You should be guaranteed at least one elite item when you trade in two elite items. Some elite items look exactly the same as or have barely any difference on them compared to the generic ones and i would love to be able to trade them in for something other than 2k XP. 	I've gotten the medic helmet, it's the same as the intel helmet I believe, just with red glass and not blue	I got the elite medic exo, finally have the load out, pants, and helmet for most of the outfit. 	1

Yeah, never hear of that happening regularly, huh? That being said my story for getting over it is pretty unique. I think I actually played it so much that eventually I just got burned out and stopped playing out of sheer boredom. I buy gametime every couple of years now but never play for more than a week.

 <CTX> With close friends, sometimes if I have an issue I just whip it out and show them everything. Last week I had a weird bruise on my tit, so I just called my friend in the back and whipped it out asking if it looked more serious. I don't know about you, but my fiance looked like he seen a ghost when I told him that my friends and I have all seen each other's parts.	Girls can do that. Now if two men tried doing that, that's a whole different story.	That story was magical. Thank you.	1

 <CTX> I wouldn't go that far. Sonic is still alive and kicking. Lost World and previous titles sold well. Sonic Boom is made by a different team for western audience so I won't say it killed Sega. In fact, the success of the tv show and comic series should keep the Boom Universe and Sega alive. Sonic is their steel beam, they can't lose him. Other than that, most of their success comes from mobile games or online games such as Phantasy Star Online (which is also made by Sonic Team). Who knows, this may be a step in the right direction for Sega, but taking their past marketing ventures into account...it's worrisome.  <CTX> I loved Sega. And I loved Sonic. But I think it's time to put him down... <CTX> This might be better for them anyway.Edit: You know what would be awesome for Sega and Sonic? If Yuji Naka came back. sigh.	All they need to do is make another really good monkey ball game. 	Lost World sold like crap.Generations did pretty good.	1

 <CTX> In my view both parties will be harmed by excommunication, not to mention thousands of members struggling with doubts, who will feel unwelcome after this.  <CTX> I would answer "Yes" to both questions, if they are expressing those views in public to a large audience. <CTX> &gt;I have a hard time finding a reason to keep in the church someone who doesn't believe in any meaningful sense even that Jesus is the Son of God.What is gained by pruning people who don't believe literally in some of those fundamentals? Is the church better off without them? Are they better off without the church?	thousands of members struggling with doubt is not the same as an already-decided unbeliever pushing his pro-cultural-Mormon-only agenda	Doubt is not forever.  It's always uncomfortable.  The Church being wishy-washy or over-inclusive will not inspire confidence in anyone.	1
 <CTX> I used to have a roommate that watched gaming on YouTube all the timeThat's actually how they edit their videos. It's like a "thing" for gaming videos with all the Lil weird pictures and sound bitesI didn't find it as amusing as he didTo each their own I guess <CTX> wow who ever mad this is terrible at editing. <CTX> Also when the 1st black car goes the wrong way, the blue one behind almost hits the red one trying to make the wrong turn but eventually goes the right way trying to avoid collision! <CTX> The ending really did it for me. Wasn't expecting them to get back into it for some reason.	What I really hate is "youtube poops".  Never understood it.  Maybe I wasn't young enough for that, as I did find stuff like Rick Rolls funny.	That is most definitely not a "thing" for gaming videos, that's a thing for being stupid. I haven't seen anything like that in any of the videos I watch. 	1

 <CTX> Having a dryer is pretty much a necessity in Ireland if you don't want your clothes to sometimes smell of damp.It is always humid, mostly overcast and sporadically rains.I only use a clothes line if I'm going to be home to take the clothes off the line or if it is unusually sunny weather. <CTX> That's so strange. Perhaps it's just my family but, in general in France, people air dry their clothes. It's only newly become fashionable to have a dryer appliance and even then, most families who have them will only use them if they have to. (Like when you start doing laundry and realise you need a shirt, or forgot to do laundry until the night before you're supposed to leave on holiday or if you just plain fell behind on laundry and there's too much to hang)But now those families, mine included, will typically stop hang drying our clothes in the winter because it typically takes longer to dry and then has a higher chance of getting mildewy or harbouring mould.	Same for me in England. We have a dehumidifier. Otherwise windows get full of condensation when drying clothes. (We also have a drier though)	Dublin here, never run the dryer, never had any issue with damp. Hang my clothes on a rack in the apartment to dry or maybe put the rack on the balcony if the weather's good	1
 <CTX> New here to this subreddit - can someone explain what the grayed-out feeder materials means, and how he went from Skill level 1 to Max so quickly?  Also, why is the third Hades less grayed-out than the first two?  Is this all to show that several rounds of fusion have taken place? (I've seen this a few times now, so figured I'd ask).	Feeding ultimate evolution monsters to each other have guaranteed skill up. No idea about the greyed out.	They're animated, they each flash kinda gray in sequence. My screenshot  caught it before the pii lit up.	1
 <CTX> If you're *really* patient, there's also a finite possibility of an HD remake at some point in the future. (I'm too lazy to Google right now, but they said it was a possibility.)That might be an Xbone/PS4 exclusive though, assuming it ever happens.*Edit: downvotes?* <CTX> Not a horrible deal but the mass effect trilogy has been on sale for $9.99 a few times before which is a much better deal than five dollars for just ME1. I'd only recommend this is you want to only play the first game, otherwise I'd probably wait for the trilogy to go on sale again. 	This is what I'm hoping for. I loved the series on 360 and want to play them again but not unless they include the DLC. It's ridiculous that the DLC never goes on sale.	Might be due to your use of "HD remake." The series began and ended on PS3/Xbox360/PC. Those are god damned consoles capable of god damned HD resolutions. God damnit. 	1
 <CTX> Holy fuck, someone put some serious work into that.By the time they were done, it was room temperature, though.	I have to assume they put serious work into photoshopping it, right?

As someone learning Tengwar calligraphy, I'm jealous of how that person can write better with coffee than I can with with ink.  	1
 <CTX> Oh a team won with Aatrox in their comp. That means he is a good champion.	LOL.  Or the champion is fine, but he is a good aatrox player and you aren't.  Gee, I wonder which it could be!

 <CTX> At IHOP I often got the little fliers that when stuck under the edge of a plate look like a $10 or $20. There were a few days that I cried in the back from the emotional roller coaster.  <CTX> Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck that.  One of my old roommates in Florida worked for Olive Garden, and she's regularly get left with YOUR TIP IS WITH GOD pamphlets in lieu of actual cash that she could, you know, pay bills with and shit.  <CTX> This is my thread! I don't care if this gets buried, I love this story.I used to work at Olive Garden. At Olive Garden, there's a dish called the "Five Cheese Marinara". You know, essentially a plate loaded up with cheesy magic with a little bit of pasta thrown in. One day, a stupid man with his stupid wife come in, and the man says "I want the Five Cheese Marinara, but I don't like cheese." I look him dead in the eye and say "Then don't order that, you're not going to like it." Instead of being a sane, rational person, the man says "Oh, can't you just have them take some of the cheese off?" Again, I repeat "You will not like this, it's almost all cheese." But he insists. I just accept it, curse this stupid man, ring the dish in, and immediately run to the kitchen. I let the kitchen, and my manager, know that he's going to send it back. Of course, my manager is the nicest man in the entire world and refunds his ENTIRE MEAL and brings him a new one once he, unsurprisingly, sent it back because it was "too cheesy". He left me four cents as a tip. Stupid asshole.	I am by no means an expert, but if the bills say that they're legal tender, you might be able to get them on counterfeiting.	Oh god I hate those fucking things. It just exemplifies that the customer is aware that leaving a pamphlet is a shitty thing to do.  So glad I don't work in the South anymore. 	1
 <CTX> Thanks Daniel!I definitely have grades that are 10 years old. I was at UT only 1 yr- fall 2004-spring 2005.The main issue would be, I have 3 courses with 'good' grades that wouldn't be counted anymore, I think?	Yeah, I think you're right about that. After looking at it again, it looks like they wipe out all grades, not just the bad ones :-/	All your grades 10 years or older will be gone if you use the fresh start. If you have taken anything less than 10 years ago those will stay.  Good/bad doesn't matter.	1
 <CTX> I would guess that mesmers will specialize in chronomancy. The shield skill shown on the trailer seemed to slow down time/mobs. <CTX> Necromancers; possibly becoming Death Knights. Light armored profession working more like a heavy armored profession = I'm happy.Ranger; becoming a Druid, possibly has a lot of support-y skills, maybe works like a supportive Elementalist and can be used as a healer or group buffer = I'd be very happy.	Reverse timewarp? That would be pretty cool condition.	yeah maybe an Time skill that inflicts damage in area, which is really lacking for mesmer right now.  Kinda exciting if that has any phantasms.	1
 <CTX> Fair weather fans are beyond aggravating. I was angry after the game - not because of the team. I can recognize that this season was sloppy compared to last year, but still, we had a winning season and some pretty awesome moments - but because people online were spewing nonsense. Calling for Manning's retirement, saying it's the end of an era, wishing the team would bring back Tebow. I couldn't believe how delusional some people could be over it. So frustrating to call myself a fan along with some of those guys.  	For the true fans like you, I wish you luck for next year. Yea, bandwagon jumpers suck. Believe me, being a lifelong Charger fan, I know how those guys are.	People are calling for Tebow back? Oh god..	1
 <CTX> The hair is fine, but a bit like the Final Fantasy movie - there is a danger of it seeming too lifelike relative to the rest of the assets.Weird that the game generally looks as good as what was a benchmark CGI movie.The shadows are FUGLY, I thought it was SSAO (looks shit in Far Cry 3) so I turned than off, but that didn't work. <CTX> Am I the only one that found the hair distracting, since the shadows weren't as high-quality as the hair?Otherwise yeah, the game is gorgeous, my 270X pretty much played everything on the default Ultra setting.	aren't there any mods or ini tweaks to bump the shadow res though?

 <CTX> It's much simpler than that. It's just competition. ISIS is trying to recruit in Talibans territory, which basically is stealing fighters from them.  <CTX> It actually makes sense, ISIS does not recognise any other nations, including the Talibans and their "Emirate". Because ISIS wants to own everything themselves.	Like a mob battle with only organized government militaries to jump in and play "war games".	So it's a big like drug gangs fighting one another?	1
 <CTX> And in that case, if he really couldn't handle being woken up, he should've turned off his phone or he could've not responded at all, there was no need for a passive-agressive stuck-up reply. <CTX> He was sleeping. <CTX> Maybe he could play around with his friend, send him a funny picture, etc. There are way more light-hearted ways to handle it. <CTX> Really? What the fucks he supposed to say?"Wow dude, you're so high and I am so excited for you! Haha dude that is so cool I am really glad you took time out of your busy day to tell me this and even though I was sleeping it's alright because I'm just so excited for you to be high."	Agreed. Though if this wasn't the first time it happened I would have responded the same.	Why is it OP's fault? And not his friend who is being unnecessarily annoying? 	1

 <CTX> Hey ron, look at my ranking bb <CTX> Hey pro, look at my ranking bb	Hahaha no you don't count that's not fair.	Did u bribe the ranking officer or something????Jk have fun at nltp.

 <CTX> *When Drusilia picks Sankri up, Mori follows suit and lifts Ginger up, cradling the wounded girl in her arms.* <CTX> "See, you'll be fine.  We can get you back to the school, and you'll be out walking around in a day or so.  This wasn't to bad riiiiiiiiight?"*The break in her voice is from when Drusilia picks her up and she winces in pain.  However the smile returns to her face quickly.*"See, no problem, right?' <CTX> *When Sankri looks down at Ginger's feet, she'll see that the ends of her boots are shifting slightly.* "Can... do..." *she says, smiling in relief.* <CTX> "We'll get you back to the school, you're going to be fine."*Sankri reassures her as the airship finally lands near by.*"Where else does it hurt?  Can you feel your toes?  Wiggle your toes." <CTX> *Ginger lets out a barely audible laugh.* "Of course... is... Does... be being.... much... strong...." *She groans quietly.* <CTX> *Through gritted teeth Sankri replies,* "You are a very strong girl Ginger, and you have people who love you very much."*Drusilia hands Sankri a bandage, and Sankri lets go of her side, right where Ginger was stabbed, and it starts spurting blood.  She slaps on the bandage real fast, but does not stand up.* <CTX> *Ginger's breathing is slightly more normal now, but she's still having trouble keeping herself conscious.*^^"Who...?" *She starts saying, seeing Sankri for the first time out of the corner of her eye.* <CTX> *Ginger is screaming from the pain now, but Sankri is very calm.  She gets a bandage and puts it right around the wound, but not over it.  She then asks Mori to let go, and replaces her hands.*"When I say to, finish the bandage.  Right when I remove my hands, you got it?"*Sankri closes her eyes and begins to glow with a black aura, which also envelops Ginger.  Suddenly Ginger stops screaming, but Sankri does, just once, then lets go.  The wound is much smaller.  Sankri collapses over and grabs at a bandage.* <CTX> *Ginger begins screaming as Sankri begins her work.* <CTX> *Sankri carefully approaches Ginger and immediately starts explring the wound.  It spirts more blood, which gets on Sankri, but she just continues.  The check is painful.*"Morthari, I'm going to need you to keep pressure right here." <CTX> *Morthari runs to Ginger's side, falling to her knees in the bloody snow.*"I'm here, Ginger, I have you. You're safe now." *She cries, taking Ginger's hand and giving it a comforting squeeze.* "You're going to get all better, alright?" <CTX> *Ginger is easily seen when the group gets close.  Mori lands first, almost twisting her ankle, but she lands without problem.  The pool of blood is ... worrying.  As soon as Drusilia lands she takes point, lighting a fire in her hand to give them all some more light.  Sankri runs to Ginger, right behind Morthari.* <CTX> *Mori leaps headfirst out of the bullhead, summoning two massive panes of ice to help guide her descent. She glides down the road, scanning the snow for any sign of where Ginger is.**Homing in on the dark stain, Mori angles herself down, gliding towards Ginger with a trail of ice and snow following behind her.* "GINGER!" *She screams into the night, looking for her best friend.* <CTX> *The ramp opens just as the pilot announces that they are here.    Following Mori out of the airship come Sankri and Drusilia, Drusilia grabbing a hold of Sankri and manifesting her wings to slow their decent.**From the air, it's not obvious where Ginger is.  The streetlights paint a pale yellow light on the ground, but many of them are broken.  However, in one yellow circle is a shimmering black stain, like a dark pool interrupting the light.* <CTX> "YES I'M FUCKING JUMPING!" *Mori screams, as if it was a question. She stands by the ramp, waiting for it to open as frost forms around her feet.* <CTX> *When the blip shows up on Mori's screen, Sankri starts yelling orders at the pilot.  The airship turns and picks up speed.*"30 seconds to drop point.  I take it you ladies are jumping?" <CTX> "O... kay..." *There's a brief pause, and Mori's scroll suddenly flashes, showing a small dot.*"...did..." <CTX> "I'M NOT LEAVING HER!" *Mori screams, her hand shaking.* "Ginger, can you hear me? Can you send your location? It's the circle button, can you press that? Please, Ginger, that's all you need to do and I'll be right there. I'll be right there, I promise." <CTX> *The airship takes off and Sankri leans in,* "We need to know where she is.  Can she set up to ping you where she is?  Otherwise you're going to have to get off so we can run a trace." <CTX> "GO, FUCKING GO!" *Mori screams, shaking from the adrenaline. She jumps onto the airship and slams the door as soon as Sankri is on board.*"I SAID FUCKING GO!" *she cries, still talking to Ginger.* <CTX> *Drusilia has called the airship and everyone is ready to go.  Sankri keeps up with Mori, listening to the sounds on the phone.  Being a little slower, Vee and Temur both go to the infirmary, to get some back up.  The airship is ready to go when they get there.* <CTX> "GINGER!" *Mori screams, tears filling her eyes as she races across campus. She runs to the nearest airship, crying hysterically.* "Ginger, stay with me, Mori is coming, Mori is coming, Ginger, don't leave me Ginger please don't leave me." <CTX> "Please..." *she hears, punctuated by crying.* "Help..." <CTX> "Ginger!?" *Mori says in a panicked tone.* "What happened, where are you, vittu vittu perkele vittu." *She drops the pair of scissors she was holding and almost stabs Drusilia's foot as she slams the door open and runs down the hall.*"Ginger, can you hear me?" *She asks, looking at her scroll to find where Ginger's scroll is calling from.* "Talk to me, Ginger, say something!" <CTX> "**MORI!!!!**" *Ginger screams as loud as she can.* "**HELP!!!!**" *The only other sounds Mori can hear are panicked and pain-filled sobbing.* <CTX> "Hello?" *Morthari asks, busy with fixing up her dress with Drusilia.* "What's up, Ginger?" <CTX> "What?" *Ginger asks. Her eyes flicker around in fear as the girls above her talk in their own language. When the fox kisses her, she almost thinks it's a cruel joke someone's playing on her.**And then she feels the cold steel stab into her abdomen.**She doesn't scream, or even make a sound louder than a confused gasp. Her hands move to the gash in her stomach, desperately trying to hold herself together.**'Need... help...' she thinks, and her hands move for her scroll as Ginger rolls herself into a fetal position, trying to keep her life from pouring out of her. 'Mori...'**She manages to get a call through, crying loudly now as the shock of her stabbing's worn off and she can feel the burning sensation of the ripped flesh, veins, and nerves.* <CTX> "[She's useless.]" *the wolf says, holstering her sidearm.*"[What do we do? She's seen our faces.]" *The fox asks, glancing over her shoulder.*"[The usual.]" *the wolf grins, exposing her teeth.**With a laugh, the fox leans in close and presses her lips to Ginger's before pushing the bayonet into her stomach. Still laughing, she twists it slightly before ripping it out, hot blood spilling into the white snow.**Nonchalantly, both girls turn and walk away quickly, leaving Ginger to bleed out alone in the middle of the city.* <CTX> "N-no! Is-s b-being **EEEEEEEE!**" *She yelps as the fox rips at her hair.*"D-d-d-did-d be b-b-being lost-t-t," *she forces out between petrified sobs.* "Did-d-d want-ted-d help-p!" *She begins crying louder, confused.* "Who t-t-elled-d-d what-t?" <CTX> "Are you fucking retarded or something?" *The fox hisses, yanking Ginger's hair.*"[She's Beacon. Isabeth spoke.]" *The wolf says calmly, her tail swishing in the snow.* "[Enych, Trakya, return home. We'll wrap this up.]" *She says into the air.*"Why were you following us!?" *The fox demands again, her ears angled to the side.* "Who told you?" <CTX> *The attack comes as a shock, and Ginger finds herself on the ground, the side of her head ringing with a sharp pain. As the metal presses against her throat, Ginger's eyes widen in fear as she starts to tear up.*"D-d-d-d-d-does b-b-be w-w-w-want-t-ted help-p-p," *she says, her voice cracking from her panic and the metal against her neck.* "Y-y-yes." *She starts making a quiet, high crying sound as the girl holds her down.* <CTX> *Once Ginger gets within five feet of the pair, the fox stops suddenly and spins on her left foot, her right fist coming from her hip and slamming into Ginger's jaw with a crack. Her left hand shoots out to grab Ginger by the hair and throw her to the ground, and a bayonet is pressed to her throat.*"Who the fuck do you think you are?" *The fox demands, the edge of the blade drawing blood.* "Are you from Beacon?"*The wolf draws a pistol from her jacket, scanning the street and muttering something under her breath.* <CTX> *As Ginger gets closer, she can hear the low sounds of the girl's voices. 'Doesn't be being what can speak...' She frowns for a moment, trying to pick up more of their words. 'Maybe is being from Mori home!'**The idea sticks in her head, and she moves even faster toward the pair, wanting to ask if they knew a girl named Mori.* <CTX> "[Trakya, to our location.]" *The fox says to no one in particular. Her own hand moves to her hip, hearing the snow crunching as Ginger moves nearer.*"[Who the fuck is this bitch?]" *The wolf mutters, her ears turning to listen to Ginger's footsteps.* <CTX> *Ginger frowns, wondering where the pair are headed. She gets across the street much more easily than the last time, now that traffic had thinned out considerably. She thought of calling out to get their attention, but decided that trying to get closer would be best. Her pace quickens.* <CTX> "[She's still behind us...]" *The wolf whispers, her hand in her jacket pocket.*"[Think she's friends with that other bitch?]" *The fox asks, her ears flattening slightly.* "[I don't remember her face in Isabeth's scroll.]"*The wolf shrugs, crossing the street and heading down a different road.* <CTX> *Ginger bites her lip. 'Hmm... maybe are knowing how can be helping find school place again...' She follows the pair down the street, hoping to catch up and ask for directions.* <CTX> *They don't seem to notice, but the wolf's ears perk up slightly. She mutters something under her breath, and the fox nods. They make a turn at the corner and head down a different street, away from the main road.* <CTX> *Ginger sees the girls and watches them as they walk, enthralled by their moving tails. 'Whoa...' she thinks to herself. After checking one way, she starts crossing the street to get a closer look at the Faunus's appendages, almost getting hit by a car as she does so.* <CTX> *After a few times of walking in circles, she may notice a pair walking along on the other side of the street. An average height fox faunus and a slightly taller wolf hurry down the sidewalk, having their own conversation. Their tails swish back and forth as they walk, the wolf's leaving almost a trail in the snow where the tip brushes against it.* <CTX> *Ginger is wandering through the city by herself, her very first time doing so. She keeps accidentally running into the other pedestrians on the street as she walks down the wrong side of the sidewalk, trying to find one of the restaurants on the map L'Gel had given her for Yule.**She realized too late that she couldn't read the map as well as she though, and she's currently walking circles around a few blocks of the city, lost. 'Should have been asking friends to be coming with,' she thinks, mad at herself. 'Does still be being too stupid for being in city place on self.'*	*The pilot has gotten out two stretchers, and Drusilia lays down Sankri, then helps Mortari with Ginger.  When they get them strapped in, she puts a hand on Morthari's shoulder and squeezes.*"Everything will be okay."	*Ginger leans against Mori's chest, her breathing soft, but steady.* "Is thanking..." *she says quietly.* "Is love..."	1
 <CTX> The Dreg mouths do look a lot like Grunt ones from Reach... <CTX> What? How? Those Fallen models were in Halo?!	I've not noticed that, but they do act a hell of a lot like Grunts with slightly less running away.	And they sound like dregs too.	1

 <CTX> ...or the fact that he lands backwards and is suddenly skiing forward again?    ^am ^I ^the ^only ^one?edit:  apparently I'm a dumbass.  Thought he was twisting that final bit to land, not rolling.  Downvotes for me it is. <CTX> almost perfect if you don't notice the tree shadows vanish <CTX> /r/perfectloops	I dont think he did. The camera rotates exactly 2 times. I think he landed forwards.	You are the only one since that's not what happened.	1
 <CTX> Welcome to console gaming bro. <CTX> Still can't believe I bought this game at full price.

FTFY.	1
 <CTX> I think about this all the time. I have two chihuahuas and while I love them to death, I can't help being reminded that they only exist because my species created them solely to have a companion that will literally die without human support. If I (or some equally caring human) wasn't around to care for these two they'd be proper fucked.  <CTX> This is probably a Shih Tzu or something far removed from anything actually in the wild. I have a Shih Tzu, sometimes I just sit there take pity on it. It's really nature's unintended retard, humans came along and eventually turned a wolf into this despicable creature with 5 inch legs. Honestly, if shit hit the fan, my dog would die so quickly. Sometimes when I let it out in the backyard and it's quiet after 10 minutes, I've convinced myself a hawk has taken her.But no, my day dream is interrupted by her barking at the neighborhood children. All of which could take my dog in a fair one. Anyways, some dogs are walking on abrasive surfaces frequently enough to file down their nails. All dogs aren't equal, some thrive, some are neglected, and    *sigh*  , some are just the product of years and years of humans selecting dogs for their appearance as opposed to other things.. like health, or the ability to adequately fucking climb stairs.  <CTX> How does this work in nature, if the dog wasn't domestic?  Surely a wild dog isn't clipped. <CTX> Seen this at my clinic also, owners excuse was the dog didn't like his nails cut, but yeah they do clip and remove them, probably need antibiotics  <CTX> How do you even treat that? Clip and pull them out? Amputate the foot? <CTX> Maybe they recently adopted the dog or found a stray, and have never owned pets?  There is no backstory here and many pitchforks.  OP where are you with the question answering?	They could coax a small rodent into their mouth from shrill incessant barking.	&gt;proper fuckedNot sure we are working from the same definition here....	1
 <CTX> Guilmerro del Toro to do Prometheus. 	Wow, your username is just amazing, completely distracted me from your answer	Might I ask why? I mean, he would be awesome for a horror film, but the direction of Prometheus wasn't the issue; it was the writing. Do you mean you would want him to both direct *and* write it?	1

 <CTX> I haven't seen any advertisement for it. If I didn't have foxtel I wouldn't have known about the Asian Cup. It's not getting the recognition it deserves. All you see on TV adds is Tennis and 20/20 cricket. Also not having on free to air isn't helping and also not live. 	australia's semi and the final are live on ABC though!         edit: apparently they aren't showing tonight's semi	If you work in the city, you would have noticed the Asian cup booth just before Colin street and swanston.Also there are some ads in bus stations but yeah in general no body cares about soccer in this town.	1

 <CTX> Both Europe and the USA have some strong suits.  You asked for positives about Europe, though, so I'll point to the way they treat driving.  In the US, we tend to engage in a lot of hand-holding when it comes to driving.  It's incredibly easy to get the privilege, and so a lot of people are terrible at it.  The response is to cater all of the traffic laws to basically the dumbest people on the road.In Europe, people are rightly treated more like adults behind the wheel, and trusted with a lot more discretion when it comes to how they operate the car.  Speed limits are less rigidly enforced, parking is largely kind of a "wing it" approach in my experience.This is not to say that any given driver in Europe is better than an American.  I'd put myself up against any of them, but as a whole society treats people in the US like morons while driving.	Stickshift &gt; Automatic aswell!	You've clearly never been to Athens.  They drive insanely and park where ever the hell  they want. 	1
 <CTX> There was no housing crash in Australia... <CTX> Please keep in mind that housing is all relative to your location.    The **massive housing crash of 2008** that everyone refers to really didn't affect certain places all that much.  My house in the DFW area wasn't affected in the least during 08, as well as investment property in MS.  Obviously if you were in Las Vegas, Phoenix, or CA you had a much different experience.     Your advice is solid nonetheless. <CTX> Paying interest to the bank is just as if not more dead money than rent.Without seeing your finances nobody here can really tell what the best course of action is. Just be careful with over extending yourself. Buying another investment property would be a very risky play, that would only pay off if housing prices dramatically rise. Every forecast I have seen suggest housing is going to stay the same *at best* and there is a good chance it will steadily decrease [and a non-zero chance there will be a bubble pop]. If that happens, you will be bankrupt.	The GFC largely swept past us. I think from 2006 to 2011, the average price of a house increased by something like 30% in suburban Australia.	This this this this stop speaking about housing crashes that never happened 	1
 <CTX> "That was the sound of books. Pages turning. I just finished the hardest one actually; Machiavelli. Understood it perfectly, don't know what all the fuss is about to be quite honest."The casting of Stephen Merchent for the role of Wheatley was perfect. <CTX> I dunno...  I'm pretty sure lines like "Aristotle versus Mashy Spike Plate" are funny no matter how they're delivered.  Hell, they could be read by Morgan Freeman, and they'd still be funny. <CTX> Ehh, his lines were ok, but the delivery was what made it great. <CTX> Dude, Wheatley. <CTX> People should play the portal series for the writing alone. Both GLaDOS and Cave are hilarious.	AH! I always thought it was Chris O'Dowd. This changes everything! Or nothing?	Wouldn't you just love it if they cast him and Karl Pilkington in Portal 3?	1
 <CTX> Why does 15 wear his jersey like that, Ohio?	Cause he's fucking awesome.	He wants to be Eddie George	1
 <CTX> I've just read this from Al Jazeera, and I think it's a good point."I guess if you insult 1.5 billion people chances are one or two of them will kill you\u2026 they don\u2019t represent the 1.5 who swallowed the insult in silence and patience in the name of free speech.And I guess if you encourage people to go on insulting 1.5 billion people about their most sacred icons then you just want more killings because as I said in 1.5 billion there will remain some fools who don\u2019t abide by the laws or know about free speech. Simply put, it\u2019s difficult to control and tame and brake down or otherwise punish or educate all those 1.5 billion people. Isn\u2019t it simply wiser to respect peoples\u2019 sacred values and sacred icons? Respect breeds respect, insult can degenerate into something worse than just insult, depending who who\u2019s at the the receiving end.Last, if you no longer have anything that you hold sacred (the death of religion and the death of God etc\u2026), there 1.5 billion people who still have \u2026 don\u2019t ignore their values in the name of yours, because values are a cultural construct, they vary from age to age and from culture to culture \u2026Last, last: what Charlie Hebdo did was not free speech it was an abuse of free speech in my opinion, go back to the cartoons and have a look at them! It\u2019 snot about what the drawing said, it was about how they said it.I condemn those heinous killings, but I\u2019M NOT CHARLIE"I think there is a danger of being offensive for the sake of it and that this might lead to more attacks. <CTX> The UK is mad on political correctness, it's terrible here. We should be mass printing that picture and showing it everywhere we can so they know that we don't give a shit and their terrorism is worthless.	You've been suckered into their pro-muslim spin.  Congrats.	Replace words like sacred icons with demands. So everyone should cave in too?	1
 <CTX> What body parts are those? I see a hand, but everything else looks like ham. 	I'll up vote you into the positives	I can't figure it out either... Wtf is that flesh-thing?!	1
 <CTX> Thank you! I wouldn't be insulted, I would probably be hesitant to eat something a fan made for me as well. I would make someone else try it first! I really didn't know what I could wow him with for Christmas, and this is something I do well as an artist and give cake art as gifts all the time. I figured, why not draw Snoop Dogg on a cake?! I even messaged him strategically to find out what his favorite flavor could be, and he listed yellow cupcakes with chocolate frosting as a favorite snack! BAM, Snoopified cupcakes! <CTX> I feel like even if he doesn't eat it, he has to appreciate the awesomeness. I love your Santa sleigh cake by the way. The reindeer on it is absolutely adorable. <CTX> Totally understandable! I make cakes as a hobby and a side business, and post them on reddit a lot. I was hoping he would see that I make them and not to be scared to try it (because my cakes are very yummy!) but I understand if someone doesn't want to eat it. I sent some box candy so that is safe to eat! <CTX> The cake looks awesome but honestly i would be bit scared to eat. Dont take candy from a stranger kind of way. But as a art its cool.	This is where Royal Taste Testers come into play	So full of awesome. :)))) He might get you to send some to his friends for presents... you should do all the rappers now... Do Method Man!!!

 <CTX> Just like a wise President to mock someone that holds no elected office...also, if he's so fucking concerned about poverty, why has it gotten worse the past 6 years, even with increase in entitlements?   Let me guess...Congress.  Yeah, I keep forgetting.	Worse?Maybe you need to stop reading all of the numbers that keep getting published upside down...	Obama acts without congress, republicans cry and whine and complain. Obama asks for help from congress, republicans say no. Obama issues executive orders, republicans call him a dictator. You can not have it both ways.	1

 <CTX> Some believe that its a powerplant..a monoatomic gold factory...a landmark for ancient alien astronauts...and khufu was also toth..jesus..ahkenaten..moses..annunaki	And those people are wrong. 	Alien hybrid race enslaved to harvest gold for space. 	1
 <CTX> It is now. Pixar is going backwards, and Dreamworks is tearing it up. <CTX> Noooo! Not DreamWorks. It's just not anywhere near the caliber of Pixar. <CTX> He worked there for eighteen years and I've spent a lot of time there! He just moved to Dreamworks though <CTX> Hi there! Is your dad still employed with Pixar and do you still get to visit/hang out on their campus?	Hmm, besides How to Train Your Dragon I truly can't think what else is making them tear it up	I think this is very true, and I wish more people would give DW a chance. They've come a long way since Shark Tale.	1
 <CTX> Not necessarily. Batman wasn't using the ring effectively at the time, and it made his constructs weak.  <CTX> He would've beat Power Ring if he had more charge <CTX> Batman has already been told he would be an excellent  Yellow Lantern and He has already wielded a Green Lantern ring I Memory serves. Black Panther would be an excellent Green Lantern IMO he would also make a pretty good Yellow One. 	Wasn't that because he insisted on being in control of the ring, instead of the ring dominating him?	We had a discussion about this iirc and his ring died right as the constructs met, plus Sinestro mentioned he was resisting the ring, it was indecisive. 	1
 <CTX> In the future, shoot me a PM. I usually have great deals on stuff. <CTX> Damn, I just ordered a new 4690k because I couldn't find a deal like this. GLWS!	Will do!  EDIT: I tried to get one the last time you had 2 4790ks, I just have bad luck.	Deals on what stuff?	1
 <CTX> Because ePalestine.com is where you go for neutral, unbiased news that is oh so instrumental in bringing peace to the land.	Stop using "Jew" like it's a slur and then maybe people will attempt to dig through your slogan-laden boilerplate to look for an argument.The article was well-written and compelling. Your racist supporting statements are what irritate people.	Two wrongs make a right, the battle cry of the Palestinian resistance.	1
 <CTX> I hope this isn't considered being a furry for enjoying girls with tails. 	I was enjoying the girl, she just happened to be wearing a tail. Either way though, I wouldn't consider it furry.	It's a step in that direction I guess, but pretty far from full blown furry. 	1
 <CTX> I know that's not enough, that's why I'm asking for specifics here! What do you eat?  <CTX> &gt;For dinner, I have a chicken breast, PB&amp;J and heat up some veggieThat's not enough man. Not even close. I aim to hit 1000+ calories for dinner alone. 	Anything that gets me there usually. A typical night looks something like this:Stuff salmon (350 calories)Mashed potatoes or rice (150 calories)2 pieces of Texas toast (300 calories)4 cups of milk (480 calories)1,280 calories	He's saying that you are asking the wrong question - before "how can I eat more often?" you should ask "how can I make my two daily meals contain more calories?" which would get you completely different answers.	1
 <CTX> I guess the tag wasn't enough?	He no reedy no well.	My brother's not big on reading.	1
 <CTX> How is this a post and not modded out of existence?  Not everyone saw this (yours truly) and it really adds nothing of value.  How about posting when the VOD is available?Edit: for reference when I posted this all it said was "LOL" 	This may be the worst post I've ever seen in this sub..."That Sneeds: LOL". Three words one of which is LOL. 	takes time for me to get the VOD from twitch. its up now :)	1
 <CTX> Holy shit. I feel bad for the guy that shot him. He sounds so traumatized.	Poor guys got a life of hearing "it's not your fault" ahead of him while shaking his head. 	Apparently he knew the guy, says his name at the end of the video.	1
 <CTX> Honest question, is he better than Willian?	I've watched Cuadrado a lot and have seen him play live, I would rate him higher than Willian tbh.	He has more flair and is faster	1
 <CTX> god damn it, [I] need to stop submitting links from mobile devices, too hard to review and avoid typos.	&gt; submitting links from mobile devicesI really don't understand why people cannot fucking wait till they come to a real computer	that's what the publisher said	1
 <CTX> That's embarrassing... Fixed. Sorry! <CTX> My name comes up as  "nfrield" on the voting page	also: "Why I Hate the Tywin Theory" by nfriel(d) (Who had the best theory debunk in 2014?)**must be "Twin" Theory**	"Krakenbowl" is also typo'd as "Karakenbowl".	1
 <CTX> And this is exactly why they dropped 'news' from the placeholder - they report stuff like this, which isn't exactly news. <CTX> I just don't know why he would go on air about being burnt.  <CTX> My lord, I was so distracted by the mascara on his lower eyelids. Seriously, the poor man needs an intervention.	You think CNN wouldn't?	And lie about things that really are news.	1
 <CTX> Lol :)NC is easily my favorite part of the south. Mississippi is a shithole, same with Arkansas, most of Georgia, etc. But NC has Charlotte, Asheville, Raleigh, Chapel Hill, and so on and so forth. I've lived here now for 10 years, previously lived in Chicago, and I'm very happy here. Even happier now that I have the legal right to marry anyone I love, instead of just half my dating pool (I like the pole and the hole). <CTX> Oh, shit. That's awesome! Get that dude a green card! <CTX> &gt; I can't really help you there :3Yeah, same sex marriage isn't legal in North Carolina. <CTX> I can't really help you there :3The "best" computer for $100/\u00a360 is a used one bought from someone who needs money! You can get some serious deals from people who need to pay rent/buy crack cocaine.  <CTX> Now all I need is US citizenship.  <CTX> Can you get all the parts you need including the monitor for under $100?The collection alone comes to nearly \u00a350 but this might be the uk being super expensive, as usual.  <CTX> raspberry pi with a $10 controller. You could play games through SNES.	Haha, I'm a Chicago native living in Atlanta and it's certainly a transition. I've spent some time around Asheville and liked it a lot. 	So wait, are we getting married or not?Edit: Would I marry a guy just to get cheap PC parts? Yes, yes I would.	1
 <CTX> medusa, legion commander, enchantress <CTX> Tbh we should have some ugly chicks in dota 2. I mean not "over-the-top" ugly but y'know, some not pretty ones. (Not counting beasts like Brood and Phoenix, of course) 	&gt;  legion commanderWhat the fuck?	&gt; enchantressu fokn wot?	1
 <CTX> So I'm English, wtf is frozen yoghurt? Is it ice cream? Is it like ice cream?	It's like ice cream, but less sweet and rich, and a little more tangy...like yogurt! You traditionally get to cover it with toppings, like fresh fruit, candy, sprinkles, whatever.	Wait until you hear about frozen custard... 	1
 <CTX> They only drop in raids, hopefully I don't forget any as this is off the top of my head:  VoG:   - Praedyth's Timepiece, arc pulse rifle   - Fatebringer, arc hand cannon  (Templar hard mode only) - Vision of Confluence, solar scout rifle   - Atheon's Epilogue, void assault rifle   - Vex Mythoclast, solar primary fusion(-ish) rifle (Atheon HM only)  CE Hard mode:    - Word of Crota, void hand canon (Crota only)    - Fang of Ir Yut, arc scout rifle (Crota only)    - Abyss Defiant, solar assault rifle (Bridge only)    - Oversoul Edict, arc pulse rifle (Abyss only)  Other:    - Necrochasm, arc autorifle (Husk of the pit/Eidelon Ally Quest)Thanks to pausemenu and kheldond for corrections and omisions.	Almost perfect list, you only forgot Vex Mythoclast, solar Fusion Rifle (primary weapon however)	The HoP/Ally aren't elemental, not sure about Necrochasm	1
 <CTX> But why would he threw it if he's right there?	Panicked? But there is also apparently "a 3 point play" which happens if you  throw and dunk at the same time...	I think to get his gun out faster? He thought he had the dunk 	1
 <CTX> There won't be a part 2, because theres nothing actually wrong, young lady.You're hysterical, asking questions about asking questions You think you're about to be arrested through....well, everything.  But you're a young girl with too much dopamine and not enough serotonin, feeling naughty for buying drugs and misiterpreting your inner conflict as external problems.You did the right thing coming onto here so men can talk some sense into you, dear.now. breathe. Slow down because you're not making sense ad we want to help you.	Tell us how you really feel about women.	I don't think this post should be downvoted anymore. People should see this behavior.	1
 <CTX> ill try to complaint, it was 500$ now spent into the game. the best card i have is giroux :). <CTX> You can't really complain. That's like me calling the Mass lottery and yelling at them for selling me a 30 dollar scratcher that lost yesterday. I'm seriously just wondering why that Campbell is still out there. That was like a month ago. Should be long gone. <CTX> i am complaining now to EA.i opened a 3rd one, got almost the same cards as the second!!! <CTX> Why the HELL is this still in packs?! <CTX> opened 2. 40$ to EA's pocketsnothing in them.the best is winter classic B.Campbell overall 86 selling for 12K !!! lol	That's not how this works. That's not how the world works.	you have a gambling problem. you seem to think that you deserve something when in reality, its a gamble. concede to the gamble and stop bitching when u dont get ur way. 	1
 <CTX> I find this really ironic because ESPN is covering the Cavs and Clippers with Mike Tirico and Mark Jackson calling the game today. <CTX> Damn, with him and Marv together TNT has got to have the most sexually deviant broadcasting crew in the country.	Wait, what the fuck did mike tirico ever do? He seems like the most straight laced guy.	Out of the loop on this one.. What am I missing?	1
 <CTX> You're from high school? <CTX> Where I'm from, publicly kiss my girlfriend. Or publicly have one.	I dunno where you went to high school, but kids making out in the hallways is like...the oldest of high school stereotypes. I would definitely not say it's something that's frowned upon. 	The fuck kind of prude high school did you go to	1
 <CTX> I just got into my class and don't have computer, can you pm me please? Thanks! <CTX> That's $14 shipped in the US, go ahead and send me a PM if that's okay. <CTX> Just kidding I forgot I just bought Lolita. Just Salem please! And that is it <CTX> You got it!  Is that all you want, or do you want to keep looking? <CTX> Can I get Lolita and Salem?	Hey there, were you still interested in this? There's some people behind you in line. :)	I'm moving on to the next person.  I'm sorry! :(	1
 <CTX> Also, I have to confess...your story about that straight boy hookup was one of the funniest things I have ever read. I was laughing so hard. I even retold it to some friends that weekend as a "story I read on the internet." Pure gold. <CTX> So do we get to be BBFs now?	Haha! Well I promise you it was 100% true. Everyone was speechless afterward. I'm glad I could entertain :)	I must have missed this	1
 <CTX> Thanks again for pointing it out, I can see it now, but not sure how to remove it from my phone!  <CTX> Hmm thanks, I can't see "NSFW", and certainly don't recall clicking it. Must be a glitch in the matrix.  <CTX> Who's to say the world wouldn't be muslim in majority then?Anyway, what's up with the nsfw tag? I assume that was an accident?	Sorry, i have no idea. I figure if it's possible to remove it it'd be one of the links below the text of the OP.	Try messaging a mod. I'm not sure you can undo NSFW, for obvious reasons (people removing the NSFW tag from their own posts is probably inadvisable).	1
 <CTX> It doesn't look like there will be any more normal horns. Both current MBT horns are ridiculous. <CTX> no (with knobs on)im sick of them, they were supposed to be for the holidays only, meanwhile those of us who want normal horns get _maybe_ one per vehicle to choose.	^ this. magriders get access to a bad-taste confetti launcher and a disco music maker. both are crap! all i want is *one* halloween horn (because halloween horns sound at least decent compared to other horns)	Well in the NC we have FREEDOM in our horns. And that shield too. 	1
 <CTX> Rangers? Yes. Palace, S'ton, Wimbledon and Ipswich? No, they weren't in that much deep shit <CTX> And Rangers and crystal palace and Southampton and Wimbledon and Ipswich and lots more. <CTX> Leeds and Portsmouth say hi!	But they all went into administration. 	Southampton were close to dying out, as were Palace.Pompey obviously as well came very close, we had to take matters into our own hands literally.	1
 <CTX> I think the tier breakdown is pretty spot on. Warlock is clearly the best, Hunter and Warrior are clearly good, Shaman and especially Rogue have it rough, and the rest are sort of middle of the pack, with Mage being in perhaps the best spot of the mid-tier classes.Interestingly, prior to GVG coming out I recall many people thinking Priest was getting the best lineup of new cards and would soon be a top tier class, and instead they seem to be pretty much as competitive as before. Not bad, but all the "shrinkmeister is gonna make Priest so OP" handwringing really didnt pan out.Meanwhile huge numbers of people were totally dismissive of Paladin, and they ended up being helped more than perhaps any other class. At least with Mage people kinda knew blastmage and chugga chugga would be great, but Paladin received a much bigger boost from GvG than seemingly anyone expected.	People said the exact same thing about Priest before Naxx funnily enough.	I'd place both Druid and Paladin ahead of Mage, personally. There's been a bunch of people playing those classes at or around rank 1 legend whereas I don't think Mage has enjoyed that kind of representation up there.	1
 <CTX> Good ideas! I will edit the main post with everyone who commits. I will also open registration date from now to Jan 20. <CTX> It would be cool if we got a list of the people participating and check how we all go through this challenge. The list would have the FRs linked next to the username of each participant. Itll be interesting to keep track of our movement.Also there shoud be a deadline for people to sign up here. In that way, we could start at the same time.	I'm also starting tomorrow (Jan 13). Fucking terrified, but I got this!	I'll start tomorrow (Jan 13).	1
 <CTX> My guilty pleasure is Ariana Grande. also Ke$ha.	I could listen to Ke$ha all day.  I could look at Ariana Grande even longer.	grande is fucking bae.	1

 <CTX> Aaron Rodgers runs out onto the field.He stumbles.He grips his calf.The whole stadium goes deathly quiet.Then he stands up, does a cartwheel, and laughs."Gotcha!"	It's such a Rodgers thing to do too	So he is gonna go full Willy Wonka?	1

 <CTX> Hey, talking about Gildeon... why he automatically owns de mystery Shack just because he have the paper of it? he is not stolen that?	In Gravity Falls possetion of a document is law.	Yes, he stole it, but since it's "his", he owns the Mystery Shack.	1
 <CTX> Well, in my honest opinion, that doesn't take that much... <CTX> There's *not* a good cut of Alexander, but there's a better one. <CTX> Is there a good cut of Alexander, the Colin Farrell movie?I think the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven is pretty great. The theatrical is sub-par.  <CTX> How many different cuts are there, and what's the difference between each of them?I also heard the same thing about Alexander, and Kingdom of Heaven.  That the director's cut is much better than the theatrical. <CTX> &gt; "Voice over is terribly dull."Then why did the studio ask for it?This is why the Final Cut from the Ultimate Collectors Edition is the best version to watch.	I'll admit it was a poorly done film, but I think making it better took some effort. They had to go over a few different aspects of it and I think it was a little more cohesive.	More tits in the dressing room. 	1
 <CTX> Yeah... not really something you'd want to be doing habitually, even if you could. <CTX> Hell, if your into psychadellics some DMT is what I'd be looking for. <CTX> Or he just does blow and booze now so he can piss clean faster.Which is definitely what any player who wants to get high does. <CTX> Tyrann Mathieu is required to drug test regularly for throwing his college career away the same way Gordon did.Not that I'm biased, but Mathieu has kept his nose clean for two years without incident. If you want something bad enough, you work to achieve and keep it. <CTX> &gt; It's part of the trap of the system to keep people in itIt's pretty clear that the NFL does not want Gordon. They had him enter into stage one of their substance abuse program because of what he did in College.  <CTX> Former probation officer here. Josh is not unique in this case. I had hundreds of people with non-alcohol related violations get alcohol testing added on to their probation. Same with people who had non drug related charges, they still got tested weekly. It's part of the trap of the system to keep people in it, and it appears the NFL isn't much different.  <CTX> &gt;Week 12, I had to agree not only to abstain from drinking for the rest of the season, but also to submit to an alcohol screen as part of my in-season drug testing under the league\u2019s substance-abuse protocol. Did I think that was excessive given I had never had any issue whatsoever with alcohol? Yes. Did I think it was hypocritical that a professional league making hundreds of millions of dollars off beer sponsorships was telling me not to drink? Yes. Did I so much as blink at the condition? No.Damn.	Neither is cocaine or alcohol or any drug really.	when you DMT, you don't *want* to do it habitually. that shit regulates itself. 	1
 <CTX> ... but, you're a Whalers fan... <CTX> Randy Carlyle was our biggest oppressing factor.  <CTX> Is it the Leafs or Carlyle that's free? <CTX> FLY FREE, LEAFS FANS!  YOU ARE FREE AT LAST!   	Everybody loses when Carlyle is in town.	A lot of us here in Hartford decided to throw our allegiances to Toronto after "The Incident". 	1
 <CTX> When it is -40C/F my idea of roughing it is staying at the Motel 6 with Tom Bodet. <CTX> HEY GUYS LOOK AT MR FANCY CAMPING WITH HIS HOUSE <CTX> I do have the right equipment. I call it a house. <CTX> if you have the right equipment, it's not a problem.  <CTX> Or don't go tenting in -35. It's -35 right now where I live and I don't know why anyone would want to sleep outside. <CTX> here's a lesson learnt: if you're going to a hot spring in northern canada at roughly -35c, don't go to sleep in your tent shortly after. your hair will freeze to your pillow, and you will have to trek all the way back to the hot spring to dunk your stupid head into it in order to remove the pillow from your aching scalp.  you will do this in front of your much smarter friends. you will never live it down.	Well he said he'll leave the light on.	As an adopted Vermonter that man knows how to stay warm.	1
 <CTX> Weekend 1 is way better. Weekend 2 and your coughing out dirt by friday afternoon <CTX> Same here. Weekend 2 even. I think that's the better week to go. 	Unless you prepare for that.  A bandana won't cut it though.	except I've been the past 4 years and have had a sand storm on 3 of the weekend 1s I've been to. 	1
 <CTX> He never did, even with the Panthers. <CTX> It's time, he just doesn't make in-game adjustments. The Super Bowl was a perfect example, Seattle shut down the Broncos' Plan A, and there was no Plan B. Sure, talent-wise the Seahawks were better, but not *35 points* better, that's all on the coach.	You can blame Peyton "choking" all you want, but I think coaching has more to do with these incomplete playoff runs than Manning does. 	he sure was good at beating the saints, though	1
 <CTX> Said these words myself: "this list is fucked" <CTX> Yeah, I think the order is completely fucked. But, to each their own.  <CTX> Ghost in the Shell at 51st? fuck that	So go make your own list so someone else can give unhelpful criticisms. 	Congratulations, you had the same thought as just about every single other person reading every list ever. You're such a unique and interesting person. 	1
 <CTX> They recently mended their relationship though (or so it seems?). So maybe next year?? <CTX> Oh. Carmen. What a loss. Guess she no longer has the opportunity to make money off the show she slams.As for Willam, I guess I'm not surprised? He hasn't had the best relationship with WoW. It's too bad because he'd be a huge draw.	Let's hope! I'm sure they aren't opposed to the money Willam will bring in. 	It really does seem like WoW is cutting off their nose to spite their face with this one. Willam is popular, he'd be a great performer on BOTS. Take a seat, and get over it whoever mandated this.	1
 <CTX> Have you looked at 4e or 5e?	This shouldn't be getting downvotes. Except for the mysterious magic aspect, 4e did all of that, and 5e scales it back a bit so you could easily bring that in. 	I was about to say: I already got my wish in the form of 4E and OSR retro-clones (I love both. Down-vote that!)	1
 <CTX> You're missing a hardcover. This is nice otherwise, but that missing first book would drive me crazy. 	It's really funny because I have the exact same collection. I don't have the hardcover for The Sorcerer's Stone for almost the exact same reason as OP. It's hilarious seeing someone else with the same dilemma, haha.	I've got the first three paperback, and I've always been annoyed by that as well - though at this point, three new hardcovers would stand out even more, since all of the books are beat to hell.	1
 <CTX> I honestly think DIG will be last.	yeah they ll get relegated 100% this season alongside T8. hopefully that ll make shiphtur go to CLG...	DIG will be top 5 don't worry. The individual skill of Shipthur, Gamsu and Core will carry Crumbz and Kiwi	1
 <CTX>  "it's already changed/ruined,so why not make it worse if it boosts sales?"  <CTX> Seeing how the purpose/vision of Epcot was a city, I think that train left the station about 1975.  What we got was a theme park that has to evolve to make money, just like the others.If Frozen apartments had been added to EPCOT, I might agree with your assessment. <CTX> of course it will be higher but it completely defeats the purpose of epcot. <CTX> The guest attendance numbers for the Frozen attraction will be higher the next 10 years than the Maelstrom was for the previous decade, no question.  I'm not for or against the change, but I do see the reasons for doing it. <CTX> &gt;When the Frozen craze dies out Disney will move on.Tell that to Norway.... <CTX> Disney is a business if people buy Frozen Disney sells Frozen.  When the Frozen craze dies out Disney will move on. <CTX> People demanded it, Disney wasn't going to push it in the parks until people started racing to the meet and greets and fighting over dolls. 	&gt;worseThat's just, like, your opinion, man.	"It's already changed, continuing a precedent set in 1955 in which all of these parks were meant to change and evolve over time, so why not continue it?"fixed that for ya. 	1

 <CTX> Past "the point of" those people were so embarrassed by her and her producers that they chose to end their own lives. The only one I can remember off the top of my head was that young mother who rolled over on her kid, what Nancy grace did to her should be fucking illegal. Flat out lied to her to get her on the show and then threw a whole bunch of judgemental, opinionated, misinformed bullshit at her after she just went through the worst experience of her life. Edit: Nancy grace pissed off this many people without them even knowing the full extent of the damage she has caused. Imagine the backlash if the media actually made this out to be a mike brown type thing. <CTX> That's nothing, she has guilt tripped three people to the point of suicide. 	whoa whoa, when did this happen?	I always wondered, with so many crazy people out there, how people like nancy grace havent had to deal with attempted assassinations and stuff. Just because they piss so many people off. 	1
 <CTX> What about the males.  Wish more people played them for comparisons. 	Did Willem Dafoe ever do a "I play warcraft" celeb commercial?  Because these screenshots sure look like it.	Not gonna lie, pretty jelly of the CM gear, the tabard and the \u00fcber ultra settings you run.	1
 <CTX> But that encourages more state terrorism in Muslim countries, whereas the latter would weaken the enemy. <CTX> That's pretty much how terrorism works - the targets are meant to have psychological value, rather than strategic value. <CTX> The curious thing is why there would be so many terrorists wanting to kill innocent people, but apparently none wanting to attack critical infrastructure that would harm capital markets. <CTX> These random Islamist attacks are so common now, The whole false flag thing is beyond tardom. The governments would need thousands of Muslim actor shills on there payroll. No one dies and they all get a new identity once the act/show has been played out. 	It's not as if global jihad is a rational ideology with achievable goals.	Are you somehow implying that people who think beheading foreign journalists is an amazing idea are acting rationally all the time?Also what exactly would you call the attack on world trade centers?	1
 <CTX> Where can you even bet in the US online? Assuming US because US dollars <CTX> OR.. someone just made 5 grand out of 50p. <CTX> So many accumulators just got absolutely shafted.	Wait, you can't bet online in the US?	Thats on bovada but there are multiple options.  I use bet online.	1
 <CTX> Please tell me you hit the top of the lift on the 'WAIT'!  <CTX> I definitely hit bench PRs to "I Just Can't Wait to be King"....no shame in muh game	Oh my god yes.

 <CTX> I worked a six hour shift once and came home with seven dollars in tips.. <CTX> You do get free pizza, and sometimes people tip you in weed. But getting cool tips is SUPER rare. You usually get fucked, I got tipped in Skandia tokens once, (we aren't allowed to count the tip in front of the customer and it was super dark so I thought they were quarters.) Also, lots of wear and tear on your car, you only get the good benefits if you're willing to track every little expense and put it in your taxes. As for the hot chicks, there are some, but they just take their pizza and slam the door. Once I got asked into a threesome with the nasty people at my work though.. Never will I work for papa johns again. Edit: typosAlso, the most memorable experience I have is when some dude requested I sing the Pokemon theme when I got there. On the drive i freshened up on the words and when he opened the door we had a crazy Pokemon power ballad duet experience.. Ten he tipped me $10.  <CTX> Pizza delivery man. Free pizza+ hot chicks 'paying'  for pizzaI mean it happens in porn all the time right? 	It seems like some nights you would do really well and then other nights you would have nothing! 	I honestly made the most tips sitting outside the pizza place playing ukulele between deliveries hahaha 	1
 <CTX> I love this controller, but I can't for the life of me play Smash Brothers on it.  You just can't undo 10 years of training on the GC.	My layout is pretty much the same, but I've got Attack on Y and Special Move on B.	I don't know why your "R" is jump though	1
 <CTX> Read that as an Edgar Allan Poe poem. <CTX> And suddenly I felt a crawling  Just like something gently gnawing  Gnawing on my southern paw <CTX> She is very cuddly! But thats just her. We had another rescue silver fox that did not want any interactions. Daisy will only bite if you try and take food away from her. Otherwise she will play by putting my hand in her mouth and gently gnawing    <CTX> Well I'm jealous. How cuddly are foxes? Do they ever try to bite you?	It was a pretty obvious reference to The Raven, bruh.	It has the same meter as The Raven.	1
 <CTX> I have you tagged as "Posts way too much" and just realised you have almost 2,000,000 link Karma...how the heck do you do it?	Take everything out of your life except eating, some sleeping and Reddit. 	He's a bot.  That's the only way you could have that much karma.  Proof is that he didn't really comment anywhere in most of his threads	1
 <CTX> I like to watch my avatar sit on the couch of his luxurious high-rise apartment. Then maybe grab a drink and take a shower. After that it\u2019s off to more couch sitting.Sometimes I\u2019ll go down to my garage and admire my cars. I\u2019d love to take them for a spin, but I hear it\u2019s pretty dangerous out there. Better to just stay indoors and relax. Maybe watch my avatar watch TV for a while.	That sounds like a advanced version of /r/lifeofnorman	Ahhh so you're that guy. There's always one guy chilling in his apartment.	1
 <CTX> Makes me want to see "Tag-Team Commander" where the colors have to overlap and only one commander can be outside the Command Zone at a time. 	Or to complicate things even further, the colors don't have to overlap, but you can only play the color identity of whoever's in the command zone, defaulting to a predetermined "main" commander if both are in the zone.	This is already a thing. /r/commandervariants 	1
 <CTX> Yes it annoys me too sometimes. Specially when it's used in advertising. 	Have you seen that ad for drain cleaner with the woman fantasizing about a plumber? It makes me uncomfortable, and I don't understand why they felt the need to make an ad for *drain cleaner* so blatantly sexual.	I don't think businesses realize how much we would appreciate them not using these things in commercials.	1
 <CTX> Holy shit, I'm on /r/wtf??? <CTX> Well, this is the worst fucking post I've seen on wtf	Yea, I just noticed. I thought I was in r/funny so confused. 	And here I thought this was just an exceptionally decent post for /r/funny 	1
 <CTX> Did you know that the butterfly actually recovers health by landing on those spots and eating the flowers?	It lives that long?	Plz Dark Souls, when will I ever stop learning new things about you? Every time I think I've seen it all, there's something new... Be it small details like OP or weird mechanics like this.	1
 <CTX> Apparently from what I have been hearing from all of my friends who own it, it is a pretty great game aside from the fact that it has a few FPS issues now and again. But I believe there will be a patch for those issues.	Cool might wait for a sale though, but thanks for the insight	Now, honestly, are these the people that are only enjoying it because it's shiny and new, and a week from now will likely never play it again, or is it genuinely a good game?	1
 <CTX> That mac keyboard is the best mac keyboard ever made. Sorry to see it die that way.	&gt; not a mechanical keyboardI don't think so. 	I think you mean the extended. The pictured one gave me RSI. I switched to a cherry brown keyboard and had a much better time. That one had too large an actuation force and sudden bottoming out. 	1
 <CTX> The fact you used a frozen reference to justify a comment about Wu-Tang Clan might be the stupidest thing I've read this week.  <CTX> ODB was in my opinion the best part of Wu Tang. It's like seeing *Frozen* if they took out Olaf.  <CTX> Oh shush, your comment is pointless <CTX> ODB is dead. You didn't see Wu-Tang. <CTX> I saw Wu Tang live last year for the first time. It was a clusterfuck. <CTX> 12 members in a rap group seems like too many anyway. Sometimes just one extra hype man on stage causes enough chaos to make the lyrics incoherent. 	Still got his point across. 	Hate harder, be more cruel. Whatever you say, your tears are his fuel.	1
 <CTX> Idk, yall are good, but let's be real the shots Thomas was making we're lucky after a pooint <CTX> We've had a major upset two years in a row. This year's team is actually good instead of lucky. We will be in the tournament next year <CTX> I don't like that and-1 call but what can you do there. This one is getting out of hand but you've got to be impressed with how Wake's competing. I think they've definitely got an upset in them this year.	He didn't really make any shots that he doesn't usually make	When hes focused those go in. Look at his stats vs ranked teams. Put up 32 on Louisville and Harrell this week and did it to Okafor today	1
 <CTX> So good news bad news. Bad news is my tv just lost signal, good news is I have 21 minutes before something happens and I need to have it fixed.	At least you have internet, use the AS Live website. 	You can always stream it from Adult Swim's website if you don't figure it out.	1
 <CTX> the stitching is really bad but other then that they are alright  <CTX> What makes the craftsmanship bad? That's my first time hearing this.Are you sure it just isn't the way AM 90s are?	What's with the title then...	stitching looks fine to me? where are the stitches you're talking about	1
